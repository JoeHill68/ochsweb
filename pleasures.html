<H2>Liner Notes</H2>
<p>
I've been away for a while but I hope to be back again soon.<br>
I'll return with a tune to show all was not lost on the naked moors.<br>
From the razor's edge of a Lourvre of loveless beds a tone tossed across<br>
an ocean of seas, pass the body please.<br>
Some might mistake it for a coin it sparkles so over the waterless waves.<br>
Others might suspect a falcon to attack their own flagellant flying saucers.
<br>
Now who would be that depraved certainly not the children of Chaucer's.<br>
But it's only a filament of fantasy diffused through the stained glass<br>
window of the haunted whorehouse<br>
the last desperate laugh of a fool's passion<br>
to say I have been faithful to the Cynara in my fashion.<br>
And a toast to the pretender who dove between kegs of cognac<br>
and floundered on the floor to be stabbed in the neck by straws<br>
once upon a time we lived by laws.<br>
From the pubs of London to the hills of Edinburgh a jealous journey<br>
on the ecstasy side of tragedy.  I watched my life fade-away in a flash<br>
a quarter of a century dash through closets full of candles with never a room
<br>
for rapture through a kingdom had been captured.<br>
And so I turn away from my drizzling furniture and pass old ladies<br>
sniffling by movie stars' tombs, yes I must be home again soon.<br>
To face the unspoken unguarded thoughts of habitual hearts<br>
a vanguard of electricians a village full of tarts<br>
who say you must protest you must protest<br>
it is your diamond duty<br>
ah but in such an ugly time the true protest is beauty<br>
and the bleeding seer crawled from the ruins of the empire<br>
and stood bleeding, bleeding on the border<br>
he said, passion has led to chaos and now chaos will lead to order.<br>
Oh I have been away for a while and I hope to be back again soon.<br>
