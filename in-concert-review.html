<h1>Review: PHIL OCHS In Concert</h1>
Elektra Traditions/Rhino
<P>
``I'm going to make a promise and I'm going to make a vow
that when I got something to say, sir, I'm gonna say it now.''
If there's one thing we could always depend on, it was this promise
from Phil Ochs. Liberals, demogoges and salesmen of all kinds
regularly felt the sting of his songs, and poor people, political
outcasts and lost souls could always depend on the soothing beauty
of his poetry. Perhaps nothing brought both of these things to
reality more readily than Phil in concert. My one and only experience
with him live was at the tender age of 14 when I was taken on a New
York adventure to hear someone who had in part inspired me to learn
to play the guitar and sing the year before. Phil was a strange
combination of warmth aloofness. His songs spoke of things I knew
I had to learn to understand, and his sweet voice was such a contrast
to the whining drawl of Dylan or the incessant growl of sixties
rock. Here was an angry young man who believed in beauty, a thoughtful
revolutionary.

captures these elements well. The album was a collection
of music from performances in New York and Boston in 1965 and
1966. His pre-song banter was funny and bitter. Introducing
<A HREF="./lyrics/ringing-of-revolution.html">Ringing of
Revolution</A> he casts a movie in his mind: ``John Wayne
plays Lyndon Johnson and Lyndon Johnson plays God. I play Bobby
Dylan.'' Here in the heart of the monster that was the Vietnam
war he calls for a revolution of decency in rich poetry rather
than trivial diatribe. That was Ochs' strong card, his clarity
of ideals that left him isolated by the didatic left and the fascist
right, neither of which had much time for poetry, art and decency
in those days. In Concert presented 11 songs, most of which were
new to his repetoire at the time but are now considered classic

and the now painfully and beautifully prophetic

These songs that were timely then and strangely timeless
now. - Cliff Furnald
