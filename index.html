Welcome to the Phil Ochs homepage.
<P>
Phil Ochs was a singer/songwriter during the 1960's
(variously categorized as ``topical'', ``protest'' and ``folk'').
He was a contemporary (and friend) of
<A HREF="http://bob.nbr.no/">Bob Dylan.</A>
(who said: ``I just can't keep up with Phil. And he's getting
better and better and better.'')
He was a prolific writer of protest songs such as
<A HREF="./lyrics/draft-dodger-rag.html">Draft Dodger Rag</A>,
<A HREF="./lyrics/i-aint-marching-anymore.html">I Ain't Marchin' Anymore</A>
and
<A HREF="./lyrics/small-circle-of-friends.html">
Outside Of A Small Circle Of Friends.</A>
His output diminished at the end of the 60's after putting out 7 albums.
He wrote little in the 70's and, sadly, took his own life in 1976.

Phil's brother runs the
<a href="http://www.michaelochs.com">Michael Ochs Archives</a> the
world's largest archive of music-related photos.  Michael has been
kind enough to allow me to use photos now owned by his archives.

<p>
Many people have contributed information to this archive.
So many, in fact, that I have lost track and given up trying to
maintain a list.  Recently, I have been trying to list
contributors names with their contributions.
Almost everybody on the <A HREF="maillist.html">mailing list</A>
has contributed (whether they know it or not :-)
Many thanks to all!
<p>
Contributions and suggestions are welcome, please send any
transcribed lyrics, annotations or image files (or anything else) to

If you have any questions, please make sure the answer to your
question is not in these pages.  <em>Everything</em> I know about Phil
is on these web pages.  In most cases, questions will probably get
better answers if they are sent to the
