<h1>Stories about Phil</h1>
<p>
Over the years, I have gotten many emails about people who met
Phil.  I saved these messages, as it seemed a shame to just keep them
in my archives, or, worse yet, delete them.
Some of them fill in details missing in the bios.
So, I thought it would be nice to share these stories.
<p>
I have done minimal editing and have omitted last names or email addresses.

Andy says:
<blockquote>
I saw Phil Ochs perform in a Washington, D.C. park in the Spring of
1969, the night before one of the major anti-Vietnam War
demonstrations. It was shortly after the revelations of the bombing in
Cambodia.  There were hundreds of us camped out in the park, organized
by geographic area and ready to march (and take other actions) the
next morning. Hearing him in that setting was exactly right. The
D.C. police rousted everyone around dawn the next morning, supposedly
something about not having a permit.

Wayne says:
<blockquote>
The famine verse from "There but
for a Fortune", He sang that at his last N.Y.C. concert at Lincoln Center
either 75 or 76. It was right after his performance on Don Kirschners Rock
(whatever) where he sang "Changes" During the concert he shared with the
audience that he had been on Kirschners Rock Concert. Some started to
applaud. We started to boo. Phil looked over to us and said "thanks, some one
still cares." During that concert he also expounded his theory that a military
coup took over the government in 63 and ever since than they held the
president hostage. He said we should all get machine guns, and do as the
dictator in Argentina did fight til the death.
<p>
In 68 I was at the republican national convention in Chicago. I saw Phil
perform numerous times at the fountain.

Alan says:
<blockquote>
I was in college from 1963 - 1971.  I had the opportunity to see Phil
Ochs many, many time; particularly in 1969 thru 1971.  Also saw him
every night while he performed at the Troubadour, in West Hollywood.
As a college student of the time, I truly loved the genius of the man
and the artist.
<p>
I used to follow him to various concerts that he would sing at, or at
least where I thought he would be at.  I wasn't disappointed!  
<p>
My career has been on the Los Angeles Fire Department, from which I
just retired after 32 years.  As a field paramedic in 1974 -76, I once
picked up Phil as a patient.  It was at this time that I had the
opportunity to talk to a man of whom I respected greatly and helped to
change my life forever.  I'll never forget that night.

KJLZ says:
<blockquote>
I met Phil, if only for a brief moment, during the Democratic National 
Convention in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel in 1968. We were sort of 
trapped by the Chicago Police in a pocket with about a half dozen others in 
front of the plate glass windows of the hotel on the Michigan Ave. side. I 
asked him if he was getting used to situations like this, and, with an 
unmistakable voice, smiled and said "not really!"

Paul says:
<blockquote>
I got to meet him in the Spring of 1974 in New Paltz, NY where I
attended college.  The quick story is that he performed at the college
on a Friday night and after the second show (he missed the first show to
watch the Knicks in the NBA playoffs!) my roommate rushed to the stage
and invited Phil to watch himself on the "Midnight Special" airing on
NBC shortly after the concert's end.
<p>
Phil accepted and showed up at my apartment with entourage.  I remember
impertinently stepping over the coffee table to sit right next to him on
the couch and while he smoked cigars and drank Heinekin on the rocks we
discussed the NBA and other topics as the crowd sat silent and
dumbfounded.  I wasn't shy and I wasn't going to miss the opportunity to
speak with him.  Besides it was my apartment!
<p>
He clearly loved the experience of watching himself on commercial TV -
I've read it was his one and only time on a network show - and he was
thrilled when a leftist song he taped actually aired.  "I can't believe
they left this in," he remarked with delight and amazement as we watched
his 19 inch image on the screen.
<p>
Phil was introduced on the show that night by Curtis Mayfield who was
hosting!

Bruce says:
<blockquote>
I last saw Phil Ochs perform in Ann Arbor about 1973, with a broken
hand supposedly broken punching a wall.  That was the contemporaneous
story anyway.
</blockquote>
<p>
Robert says:
<blockquote>
I saw him when I was  14  on the
Murray The K weekend program on Channel 5 in NYC in the Fall of 1968.
I remember Phil sitting there looking like a "greaser" and I almost
changed the channel.  Then he spoke.  The sound of his voice stopped
me.  Then he sang "I Ain't Marching Anymore"  and "Cannons of
Christianity."

Gary says:
<blockquote>
In April,
1971 I produced a benefit concert featuring Phil at Brophy Prep, a
Catholic High School in Phoenix.  The benefit was for Arizonans for
Peace, for which I was the Assistant Director of at the time.
<p>
Working with Phil was an adventure to say the least.  Within a
couple of hours of landing in Phoenix he convinced my boss to drive him
to Sedona and the Grand Canyon.  On the morning of the concert he walked
into our office very hungover and sat down at an old out-of-tune upright
piano which he requested be transported to the concert venue so he could
use it.  After several sprained backs and complaints we managed to get
the piano set up.
<p>
When I returned to our office I was informed Phil had talked our
sound engineer to drive him out to the Superstition Mountains to hike
around.
<p>
At the beginning of the concert there was no Phil and no sound
engineer to be found.  Fortunately we drafted Dave Oxman, the sound
engineer for Celebrity Theatre to work the board for the warm-up acts,
the second of which,
played for ninety minutes until Phil stumbled in completely smashed and
looking like he had crawled through a cactus field.  Our errant sound
engineer advised me that there had been numerous pit stops to and from
the Superstitions so Phil could buy half-gallons of Rheinskeller wine to
quench his thirst.
<p>
We finally got Phil on stage where he put on an excellent concert
and used our beat up old piano to do a beautiful version of "James Dean
of Indiana". ( the only song he used the piano for, by the way).  We
delivered Phil to the airport the next morning where he flew straight to
the Mayday demonstration in Washington, where I understand he had further
adventures involving David Dellinger and several federal marshals.

Norman says:
<blockquote>
In the '60s, I happened to be walking past the Folklore
Center at 110 McDougal St. one evening and went into the coffee shop almost
directly underneath; can't remember the name at the moment (it was not the
Bitter End, which was a couple of blocks away on Bleecker).  But there was a
concert that night set up by and for Dutch television with Phil Ochs, Tom
Paxton and perhaps the third person was Len Chandler.  Dave Van Ronk was
emcee (and he frequently left, by his own admission, to get a drink at the
bar next door).  There were only 10-15 people in the audience, as I recall,
but it was a fabulous concert!  I once asked some people I knew in Holland
to try to track it down, but to no avail.
<p>
I also got Phil to sing at one of the earliest anti-Vietnam War rallies in
December 1964 on Thompson St., just south of Washington Square.  It was
organized by the Committee of Public Conscience, which was a short-lived
offshoot of the War Resisters League.  Dave McReynolds was probably the key
person in the Committee and was for 40 years a key person in the WRL.  Phil
arrived a bit late but eventually climbed to the top of our soundtruck and
did "Talking Vietnam Blues."  Because he was late, my fellow organizers and
I did a couple of songs first, so we "opened for Phil."  We probably only
had 25-40 people in the audience.  But thanks to that demonstration, we
ended the war only 8 years later!  Well, maybe it was 9.

Randy says:
<blockquote>
I remember seeing Phil on the local PBS station in San Francisco
around the time that "Pleasures From The Harbor" came out. It was just
Phil, a stool and his guitar.  I saw Phil perform a few
times (a couple of times in '69 and a few times in '73 &amp;'74. I met
him once and we talked about Marty Robins. I had requested that he
sing some Marty Robins(Robbins?) one night in Cambridge, Mass. while
he was deciding what to sing next. A big smile came across his face
and he broke into "the Masters Call" remembering most of the lyrics. I
went back stage to thank him!
<p>
He was very heavy at this time of his life and his voice was pretty
shot. Before the show(at a small bar) he made arrangements to spend
sometime with two twins!
