In response to acinvest@aol.com's request of 17 Jan 1995
11:44:20, I am posting a quick overview of Phil Ochs recordings
which I wrote a few days ago for Brent Smith, another reader of
this newsgroup:

ALL THE NEWS THAT'S FIT TO SING (1964)
     This album has Danny Kalb on second guitar, putting some of
     the musical performances here into the virtuoso category--a
     feet Ochs could not do alone.  Four of the fourteen songs on
     this album are available on the CD "There But for Fortune."

I AIN'T MARCHING ANY MORE (1965)
     Four of the fourteen songs on this album are available on
     the CD "There But for Fortune."

PHIL OCHS IN CONCERT (1966)
     Ten of the eleven songs on this album are available on the
     CD "There But for Fortune."

PLEASURES OF THE HARBOR (1967)
     With this record, A&M records tried to "break out" Ochs,
     giving him a wider popular audience.  This meant, in 1967,
     trying to do a "Sergeant Pepper" type of thing.  While they
     did manage to make the song "Pleasures of the Harbor" into a
     masterpiece, they totally ruined "The Crucifixion," which I
     find in this version completely unlistenable, and "The
     Party," which I find almost unlistenable.  Three of the
     eight songs on this album are available on the CD "The War
     is Over: The Best of Phil Ochs."  I saw a Japanese import of
     this album on CD once, but it was too expensive to buy.

TAPE FROM CALIFORNIA (1968)
     Four of the eight songs on this album are available on the
     CD "The War is Over: The Best of Phil Ochs."

REHEARSALS FOR RETIREMENT (1968)
     Two of the ten songs on this album are available on the CD
     "The War is Over: The Best of Phil Ochs."

GREATEST HITS (1970)
     This is not really a greatest hits album.  All the songs on
     this album first appeared on this album.  Five of its ten
     songs are available on the CD "The War is Over: The Best of
     Phil Ochs."

GUNFIGHT AT CARNEGIE HALL (1975)
     Only a completest needs this album.  Ochs is in less than
     fine form here.  Has cover versions of "Mona Lisa," "Okie
     from Muskogee," and "A Fool Such as I," plus medleys of
     Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley songs.  Two of this albums's
     nine tracks are available on "Chords of Fame."

PHIL OCHS SINGS FOR BROADSIDE (1976)
     A number of the recordings on this record are bootleg-
     quality, although this is not a bootleg album.  Tracks
     unavailable elsewhere are "On Her Hand a Golden Ring," "Days
     of Decision," and "United Fruit."

CHORDS OF FAME (1976)
     This is a "greatest hits" 2-LP set.  Tracks unavailable on
     other LPs or CDs are an electric version of "I Ain't
     Marching Anymore"; the 1974 single versions of "Power and
     Glory" and "Here's to the State of Mississippi"; and a
     definitive live version of "the Crucifixion."

A TOAST TO THOSE WHO ARE GONE (1986?)
     This record contains previously unreleased tracks, mostly
     from the 1964-65, it seems to me.  The CD contains a bonus
     track not on the LP.

THERE BUT FOR FORTUNE (1988)
     All 18 tracks come from Ochs' first three albums.

THE WAR IS OVER: THE BEST OF PHIL OCHS (1989)
     These tracks come from Ochs' later albums.  "Kansas City
     Bomber" is unavailable elsewhere.  I think the version of "A
     Ain't Marchin' Anymore" on this CD is the same one on "There
     and Now." 

THE BROADSIDE TAPES 1 (1989)
     The sound quality on is CD is poor because the songs were
     all originally recorded on an amateur reel-to-reel. 
     Contains a Phil Ochs/Eric Anderson cover version of the
     Beatles' "I Shoulda Known Better."

THERE AND NOW: LIVE IN VANCOUVER, 1968 (1990)
     No songs unavailable elsewhere, but a surprisingly good
     album.  Infinitely better than "Gunflight."

There is Phil Ochs biography called "Death of a Rebel" by Marc
Eliot.  A revised edition was published in 1989.
