    current favorites <a href="http://www.davidrovics.com">David Rovics</a>
    and Jim Page.
<dt>17-Mar-02
<dd>Just so everybody knows: I haven't fallen off the face of the
    earth, but I did move across the country, and, sadly, I sold my
    soul to the corporate state (well, more of a lease with an option
    to buy :-), and have been working long hours.  I <em>finally</em>
    started digging through the backlog of updates, including a ton of
    lyric and chord corrections from Jan Hauenstein.
    <p>
    I finally updated the discography to reflect
    <a href="http://www.ccmusic.com">Collector's Choice Music</a>
    bringing Phil's A&M albums out on CD.  Here's a link to
    <a href="http://www.ccmusic.com/search.cfm?searchkey=OCHS%2C%20PHIL&bounce=y&searchType=artist">all Phil Ochs CDs</a>
<dt>11-Apr-01
<dd>It's about time!  It hasn't been a good year... and I've got many
    more updates queued up... Hopefully I'll get to them soon, for now
    here is the
    <a href="survey.html">Latest Revised Phil Ochs Survey</a>
<dt>8-Aug-00
<dd>I just got word that Phil's A&M albums are back in print, thanks
    to <a href="http://www.ccmusic.com">Collectors' Choice Music</a>:

<dt>26-Jul-00
<dd>Updated the <a href="survey.html">Latest Revised Phil Ochs Survey</a>,
    and other minor corrections
<dt>31-Mar-99
<dd>More updates to the schedule of
    <a href="song-night.html">Phil Ochs Song Nights</a>.
<dt>17-Jan-99
<dd>I added some updated info about
    <a href="song-night.html">Phil Ochs Song Nights</a>, and updated
    the <a href="survey.html">Latest Revised Phil Ochs Survey</a>.
    Chords have been added to 22 songs.
<dt>28-Dec-98
<dd>I've been doing litle improvements here and there for some time.
    I have added chords and made other changes to lyrics of about 30
    songs (too many to list).  I finally added some more links to
    the <a href="orgs.html">related activist organization</a> page.
    Many other minor changes.
<dt>5-Jul-98
<dd>I'm still catching up on my backlog.  I added chords to a number
    of songs, began fleshing out the <a href="orgs.html">Related
    Organizations</a> page, updated the <a href="survey.html">Phil
    Ochs Survey</a> (sorry I took so long, Bill!)
    and did many other minor updates.
    Still more to do.
<dt>18-Jan-98
<dd>I have been doing minor changes for nearly a month...  It's about
    time I upload the changes.
<dt>20-Dec-97
<dd>It's about time!  I've been busy on other projects for several
    months and have done nothing with these pages.
    I have set up an infrastructre on my home system (which runs
    <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">GNU/Linux</a>) so I can more easily
    and quickly update the pages.
