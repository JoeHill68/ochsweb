<H2>Liner Notes</H2>
<P>
Late in 1968, Phil Ochs and Allen Ginsberg performed together
in Vancouver at some kind of peace and poetry concert, the tapes
of which were recently discovered in A&M Records' vaults.
Unfortunately, Ginsberg could not recall the concert and there
was no information written on the tape boxes.  All I know about the
show is that it's one of the most intimate performances I've ever heard
from my brother.
<P>
Phil had just returned from the Chicago Democratic convention,
where he had witnessed the death of democracy as he had known it.
He claims to be down throughout this performance, but I've seldom heard
him more focused.  There's not much else for me to say, as the tapes
speak eloquently enough.
<P>
Enjoy Phil, there and now.

P.S. That's Allen Ginsberg playing the bells behind Phil on
"The Bells."

Someone who was at this concert took some pictures of
