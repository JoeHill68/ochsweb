<H1>Phil Ochs Lyric Index</H1>
<P>
This is my collection of Phil Ochs Lyrics.  I would say that this is
almost all of his lyrics.  Many thanks to all who have contributed.
<P>
I have started adding annotations to many songs since some of the
topics have become dated (i.e. who was William Moore?)
Contributions are needed for this effort.
<P>
I have fixed up this index so it indicates which songs I do not
yet have lyrics for, which songs are not on any albums, which ones
have chords, notes about the songs, or unclear lyrics. 
<P>
Please send any corrections, additions or annotations
to trent@cs.pdx.edu.  ++thanks.
<P>
