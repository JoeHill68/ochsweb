just saw it in a record store.

Liner notes by Phil Ochs and by Bruce Jackson

The CD also included the following poem:
<P>
Centuries too holidays<br>
before these days<br>
became desperately clear<br>
that chariots full of Christmas cheer<br>
could never draw the child near<br>
but this year<br>
one of the last remaining years<br>
Santa Claus is a sniper<br>
on the roof of Macy's<br>
picking off the customers<br>
splattering packages<br>
and miscellaneious toes<br>
everywhere.<br>
<p>
missionaries build milleniums<br>
and caravans of cucumbers were exchanged<br>
before the sin of sharing was uncovered<br>
and the chocolate bayonets were deranged<br>
but this year<br>
one of the last remaining years<br>
the soul brother reindeer<br>
having nothing but nothing to fear<br>
have destroyed all possessions<br>
as the holiest of gifts.<br>
<p>
hymns have swallowed histories<br>
and faded into love<br>
before a winter full of autumns<br>
had covred up their harmonies<br>
but this year<br>
thought one of the last remaining years<br>
the fading matinee idol<br>
clutching the memories<br>
of his almost unforgettable performance<br>
turns sadly away<br>
from the diminishing applause<br>
of his most terried believers.<br>
