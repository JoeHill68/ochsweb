<H1>Phil Ochs on Film</H1>

<P>
This page is an attempt to document
appearances of Phil Ochs on film, TV, &c.
<em>Note that everything I know about these films is on this page,
i.e. I do not know where to find them.  If I did, I would share
it.</em>
I welcome any contributions.

<H2>A Phil Ochs Movie?</H2>
<P>
In the liner notes of
<A HREF="toast.html">A Toast To Those Who Are Gone</A>
Sean Penn mentions his intent to make a movie about Phil.
The status of this is uncertain, if you have any information about
this let me know.

  <LI>
      <CITE>Chords Of Fame</CITE> directed by Michael 
      Korelenko starring Bill Burnett as Phil.
      It was made in '83 or '84 and made the rounds of various festivals
      (and aired on Channel 4 in Britain) but was never officially released.
  <LI>
      <CITE>The Farewell Performance of Phil Ochs</CITE> is a film of Phil's
      final permormance put together by Marc Eliot.
      It has never been released.
  <LI>
      Phil was present at the filming of Bob Dylan's film
      <CITE>Renaldo And Clara.</CITE>, and performed some songs
      including
      <cite>The Blue and the Gray</cite>,
      <cite>Jimmy Brown the Newsboy</cite>,
      <a href="lyrics/too_many_martyrs.html">Too Many Martyrs</a>, and
      <cite>Lay Down Your Weary Tune</cite> (a Dylan song).
      Sadly (from what I hear) the final film doesn't include any of
      Phil's performance.
      I hope that the unused footage of Phil surfaces someday...
  <li>
      David Schulman tells me that Phil was on the Mike Douglas Show
      in May 1968.  "He sang
      <A HREF="./lyrics/small-circle-of-friends.html">
      Outside Of A Small Circle Of Friends</A>, and perhaps one other.
  <li>
      Thomas Hanafee says: ``Phil was a guest on the old David Frost
      talk show (a syndicated show distributed by Westinghouse). He
      appeared right after the
      <A HREF="gunfight.html">Gunfight At Carnegie Hall</A>
      concert (March 1970). I remember at the start of the segment 
      Phil was sitting with Frost on the edge of the stage, right in
      front of the audience. Phil told the story of the Carnegie
      concert battle and sang
      <A HREF="./lyrics/i-aint-marching-anymore.html">
      I Ain't Marching Anymore</A> (with his acoustic guitar) to
      demonstrate the 'old folkie' Phil Ochs. I remember that his
      right hand was bandaged and Phil explained to Frost that right
      after the concert some disgruntled fans had complained to Phil
      that they felt gypped by the performance. So Phil had taken them
      to the Carnegie box office to get their money back for them. The
      box office was closed and Phil banged on the glass so hard
      trying to get someone’s attention that he broke the glass,
      cutting his hand in the process.
      <p>
      Next Frost cut to commercial and then Phil emerged in his Elvis
      gold lame suit and performed with an electric band his Elvis
      medley and maybe (if memory serves) a Buddy Holly medley.  The
      one thing I most remember in the interview was at the commercial
      break David Frost, speaking to the camera was giving his teaser
      to the home audience and said words to the affect that `We will
      next see the suit that caused all this commotion. During the
      commercial, Phil Ochs will go back stage and emerge like
      Cinderella from her magic coach...' At this point Phil broke in
      with `how about;  like Superman from the phone booth?'  Frost
      agreed that Phil’s was a better metaphor."
  <li>
      There are short clips of Phil performing
      <A HREF="./lyrics/i-aint-marching-anymore.html">
      I Ain't Marching Anymore</A> in two different PBS shows:
      <cite>Berkeley in the sixties</cite> and <cite>Making sense of
      the Sixties</cite>.
  <li><a href="mailto:brin@la.shonan-it.ac.jp">Brin Studt</A> reports:
      ``The BBC has produced a 26 part documentary called something like
      A PEOPLE'S CENTURY-- it's an attempt to provide a social history
      of the twentieth century from a non-elitist perspective, i.e.,
      interviews and film of "average" folk struggling through the
      century. I believe episode #20 is concerned with the sixties:
      Civil Rights, anti-war movements and the like. In the section
      dealing with student  rights, especially the rights of college
      students to change curriculum, living conditions, and related
      matters, a short clip of Phil is shown: he's singing
      <a href="lyrics/im-gonna-say-it-now.html">I Going To Say It Now</a>
      to a group of students, almost certainly in California, and
      probably at Berkeley.''
  <li>
      Janet Land says that she was at a Phil Ochs 'concert' (15 person
      audience) that was made for PBS Channel 13
      in N.Y. sometime around 67-68. It was aired at least 2 times
      around that time.  Does anyone know anything more about
      this... or where to get a copy??
  <LI>
      <CITE>Phil Ochs:  A Tribute</CITE>
      WWHY Video Products
      in cooperation with NPR.  Produced by Doug Bailey.  Directed by
      Doug Bailey and Russ Kneeland.  1976.  Concert was at Felt Forum
      at Madison Square Garden, May 28, 1976.  Performers include:
      Eric Anderson, Oscar Brand, Tim Hardin, Fred Hellerman, Ed
      McCurdy, Odetta, Pete Seeger. 
  <li><a href="http://www.wesweb.net/">John Wesley Harding</a>
      wrote a play about Phil, here is what he said about it:
      <blockquote>
      Rehearsals was written (obviously the full title was RforR...)
      for my theatre company - we also did a Kafka thing that year -
      for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was fully rehearsed staged
      and done but then Michael Ochs forbade me to do the play (thus
      the cancellation) because it might cause some problems with the
      film he was imminently making with Sean penn as Phil
      Ochs. Obviously this film never appeared so shame all round -
      the play would have been good, the film would have been good. I
      have since become friends with Michael and done a number of
      benefits for his neice. It was a massive shame it didn't happen
      at the time, but I think it might be done one day - it works
      rather well, at least on the page. We had two actors be Phil and
      the whole play was set the night before he died looking back on
      his life. 
      </blockquote>

  <li>The movie "Spanking the Monkey" contains at least two overt
      references to Phil Ochs' suicide. In one, the lead character
      says something like "Phil Ochs used a belt to commit suicide,"
      to which his companion brilliantly responds, "Who's Phil Ochs?"
      (I don't think any of Phil's music was included in the film,
      though -- at least I didn't hear any!) -- Brett Garrett
      (brett@alumni.caltech.edu) 
  <li>``I've seen a film called ``Melvyn and Howard'' based on the legend of
      Howard Hughes having befriended a hitch-hiker and making him his
      heir.  The film features *two* of Phil's songs:  <A
      HREF="./lyrics/gas-station-women.html">Gas Station Women</A> and
      <A HREF="./lyrics/my-kingdom-for-a-car.html">My Kingdom For A
      Car</A>.  They are heard in the
      background track as the two are riding in a car.  It was my
      impression that they were intended to be perceived as coming
      from the radio.  As Phil's music almost never made it to the
      radio I though this was superbly ironic.''
      <p>
      The film won an Academy Award in 1980 for Best Supporting
      Actress:  Mary Steenburgen.
      -- David Staudacher (quiet@igc.apc.org)
  <li>``Aileen Warnous:  The Selling of a Serial Killer.''
      There is a scene in which the woman's odd-ball attorney grabs
      his guitar, pulls out his Phil Ochs songbook and serenades her
      with <a href="lyrics/iron-lady.html">The Iron Lady.</a>
      I'm not sure if the woman receives the death penalty, but she
      definitely faces it for her crimes.  A truly disturbing filmic
      moment. -- Edward Hargrove
  <li>A documentary film entitled UNDERGROUND (composed of 
      interviews of several members of the Weather Underground and shot in 
      1975(?)) which includes a short audio clip of
      <a href="lyrics/war-is-over.html">The War Is Over</a>. In 
      addition, there's a docudrama of the Chicago Eight Trial (yes, Seale 
      counts!) recorded for HBO films(?) which includes an audio clip of
      <a href="lyrics/i-aint-marching-anymore.html">I Ain't Marching
      Anymore</a> (the background to Abbie's self-produced film 
      submitted as evidence by the defense team). -- Shimon Lerner
  <li>The Smothers Brothers performed
      <a href="lyrics/draft-dodger-rag.html">Draft Dodger Rag</a> 
      although it was censored from the broadcast. Fortunately
      <a href="http://www.aentv.com/home/smobro/censored_body.htm">
      a film clip is available online</a>.
  <li>Valerio Orselli reports seeing
      ``a great Phil Ochs performance on PBS Channel 13 TV station in
      New York.  The name of the program was Soundstage.  The
      performance consisted on Phil Ochs on a high stool, playing
      acoustic guitar.  It lasted some 90 minutes.  Amongst the songs
      he performed was <a href="lyrics/crucifixion.html">Crucifixion</a>.
      I don't recall the year, but he was in excellent form so it must
      have been 1969-1972.''
      Does anybody know anything about this??
  <li>Ken Judkins tells me that Phil appeared on the old
      "Midnight Special" TV show that was fairly popular on network TV
      (I think it was ABC?) in the early '70's. He sang
      <A HREF="./lyrics/chords-of-fame.html">Chords Of Fame</A>.
      I recall hearing or reading a story somewhere (years ago)
      that Phil originally intended to sing
      <A HREF="./lyrics/heres-to-the-state-of-richard-nixon.html">Here's
      to the State of Richard Nixon</A>, but it was nixed by the
      network people.

      I think I saw this clip as well, and if I remember right, he had
      a cast on his right hand, and Jim Glover was singing backing
      vocals.
  <li>Rich Sautter tells me:
      I wanted to let you know about some Ochs footage I saw about 15
      years ago.  Apparently they filmed the acts that used to play at
      The Bitter End, a New York coffeehouse, I believe in Greenwich
      Village, back in the 60's.  In the early 80's, they spliced
      together some of those appearances for television syndication as
      a series called (as I recall) "Live from the Bitter End", which
      featured Rick Nelson as host, introducing the 20 year-old
      segments.  Phil's set included "I Ain't A-Marching", "Flower
      Lady", "The War Is Over", and "And There But For Fortune".
      Whether or not there was more film of Phil from that gig that
      wasn't used in the series, I don't know.  I wish I'd had a VCR
      back then, because the sound and image reproduction was very
      good and Phil was in fine form.  I have no idea if this series
      is available anywhere.  I hope it is.
  <li>Phil's voice made a cameo appearance on an episode of "Family Ties"
      once.  Michael Gross, as the Dad character, was listening to it on his
      stereo.  I think the song was
      <A HREF="./lyrics/days-of-decision.html">Days Of Decision</A>.
</ul>

Alf Storrud says:
``Recently I was offered these for sale but turned it down since the
price vas HIIIIGH!!!!''
<p>
``However these videotapes exist and the quality - I was told - was
excellent/very good''
<p>
Looking at this list, I realize that I saw many of them.  They were
the ``opening act'' for Dave Van Ronk when he played the Aladdin
Theatre in Portland, OR (21-Feb-97)
