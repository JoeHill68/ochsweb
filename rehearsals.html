<H2>Liner Notes</H2>
<P>
(The Pickwick reissue has liner notes by
Howard Brinkman in place of the liner notes below)
<P>
This then is the death of the American<br>
imprisoned by his paranoia<br>
and all diseases of his innocent inventions<br>
he employs the farce of force to crush his fantasies<br>
he calls conventions of salesmen and savages<br>
to reinforce his hopelessness<br>
So the poet swordsmen and their lost generation<br>
must divorce themselves from their very motherland<br>
only for the least sensation of life or love or pain<br>
our deepest and most religious moments<br>
were on elevators posing as planes<br>
<p>
Part two of this earnest epic<br>
finds seaweed lapping against your eyes<br>
the sailors have chosen the mystery surprise<br>
to join the flying dutchman in his search for a green disguise<br>
Still others invade the final colony<br>
to present their tinted tributes to the millionaire assassin<br>
While I stumble through this paradise<br>
considering several suicides<br>
for distant lavender lovers<br>
or bless the violence of the ridiculous revolution<br>
for self bronzing brothers<br>
and finally turn away from the turquoise towers<br>
of this comic civilization<br>
my responsibilities are done let them come let them come<br>
and I realize these last days these trials and tragedies<br>
were after all only<br>
our rehearsals for retirement.
