Someone was selling a copy of this on Ebay and had this commentary
(which is undoubtedly exagerated if not false, but it is good for a laugh):
<blockquote>
This is the ultra-rare LP by folk legend Phil Ochs'
first professionally-recorded band. For a short while in the early
'60s The Campers were a popular touring act, bringing traditional
campfire songs to hundreds around the globe. Consisting of Ochs, a
woman who preferred anonymity and several children (who also preferred
anonymity), The Campers reached the peak of their success with the
smash hit single "Polly Wolly Doodle" b/w "Friends Friends Friends."
Although the follow-up single "Hambone" b/w "Crucifixion" failed to
chart, The Campers remained a top attraction on the campfire circuit
until an unfortunate incident while on tour doomed the group
forever. Although the circumstances remain unclear, Ochs was arrested
at a campfire in Florida and charged with violating federal child
labor laws. As part of a plea bargain agreement, Ochs agreed not to
play in a band for seven years. All copies of the yet-to-be-released
"Camp Favorites" were ordered destroyed but, amazingly, several copies
-- including this one -- managed to escape the incinerator! Ochs
reluctantly retired The Campers and soon moved to New York City where
he began performing as a solo artist. Bitter about his legal troubles
and the demise of his band, Ochs wrote scathing songs blasting the
government and its policies... And the rest is history.
