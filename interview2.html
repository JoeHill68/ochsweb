<h1>Phil Ochs Returns from the Dead</h1>
<p>
by Marco Livingstone,
Sounds, May 18, 1974; page 41
(illustrated by a photo of Bowie and one of Alice Cooper,
with the pull quote "I object to them becoming the focal point of music")
<p>
"I'm an old timer from way back in the 1960's" Phil Ochs told a
capacity audience during a week's stay at the Riverboat in
Toronto. "Things were different back then. The fad was not so much
streaking as striking... over various political causes."
<p>
At the peak of political activity in the States six or seven years ago, Ochs was far and away the most articulate and hard-hitting of the so-called "protest singers."  Instead of reacting with the moral outrage of Dylan or the naïve idealism of Joan Baez, he attacked injustices with a bitter ironic humour and a realistic appraisal of the problems, which lay ahead.
<p>
Interest in left-wing causes began to wane around 1970 and so did Ochs's career. After recording the prophetically titled "Rehearsals for Retirement" and the rock and country "Greatest Hits" he took time off to travel through South America, Indo China and Australia, playing concerts along the way. Yet he wrote no new songs and stayed away from the studio. In the words of his record company, "he was a dead artist."
<p>
Last summer, Ochs experienced a sudden burst of popularity when he filled the Riverboat twice a night for two weeks, instead of playing for the expected three days and since then it has become obvious that his career has come back to life. 
<p>
A & M records in Canada and Japan have just released a controversial live album recorded four years ago, "Gunfight at the Carnegie Hall". He broke all house records
At New York's Max's Kansas City (where one side of his new single was recorded) and
In a month, he will be featured on the American rock show "Midnight Special"
<p>
In view of the sudden flurry of interest, the four years of self-imposed silence seem very strange. The first thing I asked Phil back at his hotel was why no new albums had come out in such a long time?
<p>
"What happened was that the Carnegie Hall concert I did in March 1970 after "Greatest Hits" There were a lot of problems with setting up the equipment, and a bomb scare and after it was recorded, A & M didn't want to put it out. There was booing on the record and they didn't like it.
<p>
"It was all part of a three week rock and roll tour, the only one I ever did where I wore the gold suit and did some '50's rock- and this was before the rock and roll revival. I was trying to expand the political stuff rather than reacting against it. Instead of being an 'intellectual social critic' I wanted to move more into a fundamental working class area. I was weaned on '50's rock and when I was 15, I was listening to Elvis and Gene Vincent- that was actually my folk music in essence, the car radio.
<p>
The idea of the show was to do a combination of '50's rock while still doing folk and protest, and also adding elements of right wing country and western like Merle Haggard. To put it all together and say "All this should be compatible." It was a political statement ....in other words, you have to organise the working class by doing it in musical terms. There's a specific statement on the record that there has to be a revolution in America- a socialist revolution - and the only way of doing it is by making Elvis Presley into Che Guevera."
<p>
Was it essentially to widen your audience then that the concert and
album included Buddy Holly and Elvis medleys and even Merle Haggard's "Okie from Musgee."
<p> 
"It was partly that, but it was also a discussion of the nature of all this music, of how it can fit together as shown by this album. So anyway, it was a giant frustration and a big block to have been so excited by this record and then to have it sat on for three years. Now that it's been put out in Canada, if it's successful here - and I'm sure it will be - it will come out everywhere."
<p>
Although this explains the delay in releasing the live LP, it still doesn't make it clear
Why one of the most influential songwriters of the '60's hadn't ventured back into the studio.
<p>
"I haven't been writing - that's all. The songs haven't come - I don't know why - I don't know why they came in the first place. When they do come, I'll put another album out. Which leads to the single, which has just come out. It's got "Here's to the state of Richard Nixon", a left wing song that was based on Johnny Cash's "Mississippi." on one side and 'Power and the Glory' - which is a patriotic song done in the spirit of '76, fife and drum, John Philip Sousa which would sound like a right wing single on the radio. That's also related to 'Gunfight' the same combination of straight political stuff against really early American stuff.  I also cut a single in Africa, one side in Swahili and the other in a language of the Congo which has been released there and which will go on the next album along with a rock and roll version of 'Kansas City Bomber.' Basically, the album would be me doing other people's material, rerecordings of older songs like 'Changes,'
a Hank Williams tune and an Ewan McColl tune."
<p>
Politically, Ochs is as active as ever - aside from organising a big concert with Pete
Seeger and Arlo Guthrie to bring attention to the situation in Chile after the recent 
military coup, he has updated many of his best known songs to include references
to Nixon, Watergate, unions, prisons, Chile, and the amnesty issue. As far as he is concerned, people can still be stirred by political issues. In view of his feeling that music should play a positive political role, I wondered how he felt about the glamorous image and music of people like David Bowie and Lou Reed.
<p>
"I don't like it. It's been my experience that when music is good, it grabs me - the  Beatles, the Stones, the Beach Boys, the same thing when Creedence Clearwater
came out. I haven't had that impulse to really listen to anyone lately - the closest guy 
that's come in musically strong has been Elton John.
<p>
The only thing of Bowie's that I liked was 'Space Oddity' - it had a Beatleesque prettiness to it... I understand that people like Bowie and Alice Cooper are great performers in the use of theatre and that's valid, but I object to too many groups like that being the focal point of music. I think that it's degenerate, ultimately."
<p>
Ochs's reemergence as a major artist may point to the fact that the whole glitter scene is in its death throes so that people are ready again for topical songs with the lives that we lead and the problems that we face. If that is the case, who better to sing to us than Phil Ochs whose anti corporate, anti war statements ring as true today as when they were written.
