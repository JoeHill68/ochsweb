<H1>Phil Ochs Quotes</H1>
<p>
This is my collection of Phil Ochs quotes:
<P>
<blockquote>
Does defending liberalism leave you friendless and perhaps wondering
about your breath?
(from <cite>Have you Heard? The War is Over!</cite>, 1967)
</blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[The demonstrations were] merely an attack of mental 
disobedience on an obediently insane society...and if you feel you have 
been living in an unreal world for the last couple of years, it is 
particularly because this power structure has refused to listen to 
reason...Step outside the guidelines of the official umpires and make 
your own rules and your own reality.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(from <cite>An American Ordeal: The Antiwar 
Movement of the Vietnam Period</cite> by Charles DeBenedetti (Syracuse Univ. 
Press, 1990).
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
America is two Mack trucks colliding on a superhighway because
all the drivers are on amphetamines.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is wrong to expect a reward for your struggles. 
The reward is the act of struggle itself, not what you win.
Even though you can't expect to defeat the absurdity
of the world, you must make that attempt.
That's morality, that's religion. That's art. That's life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
God isn't dead--he's just missing in action.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From the liner notes of
<A HREF="broadside1.html">The Broadside Tapes 1</A>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When they show the destruction of society on color TV, I want to be
able to look out over Los Angeles and make sure they get it right.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Leaving America is like losing twenty pounds and finding a new girlfriend.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A protest song is a song that's so specific that you cannot mistake it
for bullshit
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And if there's any hope for America, it lies in a rebolution, and if there's
any hope for a revolution in America, it lies in getting Elvis Presley to
become Che Guevara.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The final story, the final chapter of western man, I believe, lies
in Los Angeles.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From Phil's intro to
<A HREF="lyrics/world-began-in-eden-and-ended-in-la.html">The World Began In
Eden And Ended in Los Angeles</A>
on <A HREF="livevanc.html">There and Now - Live in Vancouver 1968</A>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was over there, entertaining the troops.  I won't say which troops.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From Phil's intro to
<A HREF="./lyrics/marines-santo-domingo.html">The Marines Have Landed
on the Shores of Santo Domingo</A> on <A HREF="in-concert.html">Phil
Ochs in Concert</A>
and <A HREF="fortune.html">There But For Fortune</A>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before the days of television and mass media, the folksinger was
often a traveling newspaper spreading tales through music.  There is
an urgent need for Americans to look deeply into themselves and their
actions, and musical poetry is perhaps the most effective mirror
available.  Every newspaper headline is a potential song.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From <CITE>Broadside</CITE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   "Leave the old and dying America and use your creative energies to 
help form a new America, which would be de-militarized, more humanistic, 
where the police are less hostile and closer to the community, where the 
wealthy are not given unleashed power for the exploitation of the people.
<p>
"And, mostly because it's now a matter of life and death, reassert an 
ecological balance with the environment, which means the people in the 
oil companies and the car companies and the space industry and all the 
other industries will have to be brought into account, so that there will 
be a new definition of government which has to be closer to the people 
and less close to special interests which are far more harmful than any 
revolutionaries."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From an interview with Michael Ross, 1969
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I can spare a dime, brother, but in these morally inflationary 
times, a dime goes a lot farther if it's demanding work rather than 
adding to the indignity of relief."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From the liner notes of <A HREF="i-aint.html">I Ain't Marching Anymore</A>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A pamphlet, no matter how good, is never read more than once, but a song
is learned by heart and repeated over and over.
        -- <A HREF="lyrics/joe-hill.html">Joe Hill</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Admittedly, this isn't a Phil quote, but I think it is apropos.
