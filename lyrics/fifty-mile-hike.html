<H1>Fifty Mile Hike</H1>

<PRE>
Some people never get their feet on the ground,
they're either sitting in a chair or they're laying down
their bellies are hanging down on their knees,
it's almost a national emergency.
	Fifty miles, keep a-walking,
        Twenty-five miles and you're almost there,
        Fifty miles no use a-talkin',
        better get in step with the new frontier.

Well, the President put on his walkin' shoes
he had a country with 30 millions pounds to lose
he remembered a promise he made 'way back when   
He's gonna get the country movin' again.
*chorus*

Then everybody started getting into the act
Even Sallinger left but he soon came back
On his return he was heard to say
Fifty miles a day keeps Republicans away
*chorus*

Rockefeller's happy with his brand new wife,
and Richard Nixon's done enough running for life
and Lyndon Johnson is too busy a man
and Joseph P. Kennedy bought out Tom McCann.
*chorus*

So I decided I would carry my load
I grabbed a carton of cigarettes and I hit the road,
The golf clubs were heavy and the gin was slow
If you want to get healthy, that's the way to go.
*chorus*

While everybody's goin' out and havin' fun
they ought to lose some weight in more ways than one
fity miles of thinking is a heavy strain
but it's about the only cure, for an overweight brain.
*chorus*
