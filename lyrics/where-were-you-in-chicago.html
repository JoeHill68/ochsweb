<H1>Where were you in Chicago?</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>

Oh, where were you in Chicago?
You know I didn't see you there
I didn't see them crack your head or breathe the tear gas air
Oh, where were you in Chicago?
When the fight was being fought
Oh, where were you in Chicago?
'Cause I was in Detroit.

"That's about the movement psychology."
