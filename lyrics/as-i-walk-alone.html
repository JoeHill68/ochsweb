<H1>As I Walk Alone</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
As I walk alone
Through each troubled day
I hope the lord above will help guide my way
Guide my way
As I walk alone

Through the valleys I will roam
Searching for the rivers leading to my home
To my home
As I walk alone

Listening to the wise men from the years of old
Trying to remember the words the bible told
As I walk alone

Towards heaven I will fly
If the devil calls me I'll pass him by
Pass him by
As I walk alone

As I walk alone
I'll pass him by

</PRE>
