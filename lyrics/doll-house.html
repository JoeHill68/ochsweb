<H1>The Doll House</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
D           G         D
Lost in the valley of vaults/dolls/Oz(?)
G             D            G        D
Fell from the path, it was nobody's fault
     Bm      A 
That I was alone.
D    G                D
Time dripped from the trees
G                     - D
Left through the nail           (I leapt through a lamp/land/lap/laugh(?) (?))
  G          D     G          A
I fell to my knees before the throne
                  Bm           G            Bm
And the crown was covered jewels, sparkling schools
              A
The beautiful fauns/falls/(?)
    G                      A
The magnificent battle was fought
        Bm         G                A
And Cinderella's soldier fish was caught
        Bm            A
And the lady from the lake
    Bm              A
Who helped me to escape
G            Em      A
Led me to myself at last
         Em              A            Bm         /A/D
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house

G   D      G            D
The flower fled from my feet,
G          D                 G           D
Tom Sawyer voice through the hole of the key,
Bm        A
Landed so gently.
D         G            D
Castles cover the cave,
G        D           G            D
I had no choice, the visions were brave
        Bm            A
And the phantoms were friendly,
    Bm               G
And Pirate Jenny was dancing for pennies,
    Bm                       A
The knucklebones tossed in a spin,
           G                   A
There were silver songs on her skin.
    Bm                G                  A
And she wasn't caring when the ship came in.

And the lady from the lake
Helped me to escape
Led me to myself at last,
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house


   D       G              D
My costume dropped to the floor,
G        D                G         D
Naked at last, I couldn't fight any-more,
        Bm          A
And the service was rendered.
   D   G             D     G          D
A poem fell from the wine, buried the past.
    G          D            Bm          A
The future was mine and the present sur-rendered.
        Bm               G
And the ballet master is beckoning faster,
    Bm            A             G                 A
The ballerina was posed, in the fragile beauty we froze.
    Bm              G               A
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go.


And the lady from the lake
Who helped me to escape
Left me with myself at last
Though I danced with the doll in the doll house
