Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)
Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)
Bwatu ya bolingo, bwatu a salongo		(Canoe of love, canoe of work)
Bwatu e, bwatu ya ndenge moko		        (Canoe, canoe of the same way)
Bwatu ya bolingo, bwatu a salongo		(Canoe of love, canoe of work)
Bwatu e, bwatu ya ndenge moko		        (Canoe, canoe of the same way)

Ebale ezali molayi				(The river is so long)
Mayi ekotiola mbangu				(Water is running down)
Ebale ezali molayi				(The river is so long)
Mayi ekotiola mbangu				(Water is running down)

Tonana na bokasi				(Let's paddle with strength)
Tonana na bokasi				(Let's paddle with strength)
Tonana na bokasi				(Let's paddle with strength)
Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)
Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)

Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)
Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)
Bwatu ya bolingo, bwatu a salongo	        (Canoe of love, canoe of work)
Bwatu e, bwatu ya ndenge moko		        (Canoe, canoe of the same way)
Bwatu ya bolingo, bwatu a salongo		(Canoe of love, canoe of work)
Bwatu e, bwatu ya ndenge moko		        (Canoe, canoe of the same way)

Ebale ezali molayi				(The river is so long)
	Like the river of wine
Mayi ekotiola mbangu				(Water is running down)
	Making like the rain
Ebale ezali molayi				(The river is so long)
	Taking the time, broken the chain
Mayi ekotiola mbangu				(Water is running down)

Tonana na bokasi				(Let's paddle with strength)
	not too far to ride
Tonana na bokasi				(Let's paddle with strength)
	For the freedom sign
Tonana na bokasi				(Let's paddle with strength)
	We cried...
Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)
Bwatu e e, bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)
	
Bwatu ya bolingo ekomi na ngambo		(Canoe of love has
                                                 arrived in the other side)
Tonani makasi tokomi na ngambo		        (We have paddled with strength 
                                                 and have arrived in the
                                                 other side)
Bwatu ya salongo ekomi na ngambo		(Canoe of love has 
                                                 arrived in the other side)
Tonani makasi tokomi na ngambo		        (We have paddled with strength 
                                                 and have arrived in the 
                                                 other side)
Bwatu ya bolingo bwatu a salongo		(Canoe of love, canoe of work)
Bwatu e e bwatu ya ndenge moko	                (Canoe, canoe of the same way)

Bwatu e e Bwatu e e				(Canoe, Canoe)

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<P>
This song was recorded in 1973 in Kenya with the Pan African Ngembo
Rumba Band.
On the original single Dijiba and Bukasa (whoever they might be)
are co-credited with writing the song.
The song is written in Swahili.
The transcription and translation are thanks to: a. omar, k. lunvuna
and zuni migozi.  And, of course Dave Cohen who guessed at the english
lines and posted the whole thing.
