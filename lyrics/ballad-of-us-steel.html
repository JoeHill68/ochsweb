<H1>The Ballad Of U.S. Steel</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>
See the man with the glasses, his name is Roger (?)
he went to see the president, say "hello" and rush out (?)
"I got to tell you we need a small price rise"
But honest John just looked at him with ice cold steely eyes
	U.S. Steel won't be stealing anymore
	JFK come to life and close the door
	They shovel slag on the public's back
	Inflation raced down the track (?)

JFK paced up and down, he was very ill at ease
Said "my daddy told me they're a bunch of SOBs
This follow the leader pricing is cake with too much icing
Adam Smith is turning over if this is free enterprising"
	*chorus*

Then Kennedy conference it was seen all over the land
The spirit of the Roosevelts was once again in command
With the public on his side, well he finally turned the time
And William Buckley almost comitted suicide
	*chorus*
