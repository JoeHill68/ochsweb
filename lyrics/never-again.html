<H1>Never Again</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
I don't know, but it seems to me
What a great world this would be
If everybody stoped their hating
Saw the devil and called him satan

*chorus*
Never again, never again
No more the bugle sounds the battle cry
No more the cannons' roar
No more we die

If all our boundaries melted away
From the China sea to the USA
Flags of war at last were faded
One world at last created

*chorus*

And if every man on every shore
cast a ballot for peace or war
And when all votes were counted
white dove of peace was mounted

*chorus*
*repeat last verse*
*chorus*

</PRE>

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<p>
I don't know about you, but the use of the word "mounted" brings to
mind taxidermy, which I don't think Phil indended for the "dove of
peace" :-)
