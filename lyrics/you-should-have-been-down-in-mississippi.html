Pardon me, all you people
who enjoy your peace of mind
you say everybody's equal
Everybody is doing fine.
	You should've been down in Mississippi
        in the summer of sixty-four
        if you were down in Mississippi
        you wouldn't say that anymore.

Pardon me, Mr.Backlash,
you say you're worried about your home
you say we're going too far too fast
you say you want to be left alone.
*chorus*

Pardon me, Mr.Policeman,
why are you shining up your shield
you say you stand for law and order
you wouldn't do no dirty deals.
*chorus*

Pardon me, Mr. Soldier,
why are you marching down the road
you say you're fighting for your future
and the freedoms that you hold.
*chorus*

Pardon me, Mr. President,
you want your place in history
you say you're doing all you can do
to makle all the people free.
*chorus*

Pardon me, all you people
who enjoy your peace of mind
you say everybody's equal
Everybody is doing fine.
*chorus*
