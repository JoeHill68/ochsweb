Em         A                D          G
I'd like a one-way ticket home, ticket home
      Em          A           D                  D
Where I can watch television, talk on the telephone
Em                 A                       D
But every town I wander there's a billboard on a throne
         A7
Ticket home
                D
I want a ticket home

Em           A                D              G
Does anybody know my name, or recognize my face
  Em                  A                    D              G
I must have come from somewhere, but I can't recall the place
      Em               A             D              G
they dropped me at the matinee, they left without a trace
         A7
Ticket home
                D
I want a ticket home

G                                       D
Elvis Presley is the king, I was at his crowning
   E                                G          A
My life just flashed before my eyes, I must be drowning

Seems like only yesterday I climbed aboard the plane
Raping distance in the skies, while diving in champagne
I would be in exile now, but everywhere's the same
Ticket home
I want a ticket home

Elvis Presley is the king, I was at his crowning
My life just flashed before my eyes, I must be drowning

Seems like only yesterday I climbed aboard the plane
Raping distance in the sky, while diving in champagne
I would be in exile now, but everywhere's the same
Ticket home
I want a ticket home
