<H1>Song of my Returning</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>
(play with barre chords)
    B              E              B              G#m
The wild geese are dancing in the ripples of the morn
   B             E
My wanderlust is born
            D#m         C#m               F#m
I've got to follow them wherever they may lead
    B           E           B               G#m
For I am just a sailor on a ship across the land
B                E
Let me hold your hand
           D#m           C#m          F#m
to bid farewell so i can not go to my knees
B           D#m           G#m      
But I'll be back again no matter where I go
         C#m            F#m                B
For it's only love that frees the fire for burning
B                  D#m            G#m  
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know
     C#m            F#m            B
As I sing the early song of my returning

The weary world is waiting for ambition to be played
Now young and not afraid
I've got to challenge every chalice that I know
My eager ears are listening for the singing of the sign
Deeper are the lines
upon the face that finds reflections in the road
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go
For it's only love that frees the fire for burning
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know
As I sing the changing song of my returning

My drifting days prepare me to do battle with the night
A phantom of the fight
I've got conquer all the courage of my fears
The answer lies in limbo(?) and the harvest will be hard
But sacred are the scars
That leave their mark on the fast disolving years
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go
For it's only love that frees the fire for burning
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know
As I sing the growing song of my returning

Time must have her victory
It's that I've always known
But I won or lost alone
And when a voice calls out "there's someone you must meet"
With every strength remaining
I will suffer one more scene
I'll gather all my dreams
And with my final breath
I'll lay them at your feet.
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go
For it's only love that frees the fire for burning
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know
As I sing the final song of my returning
