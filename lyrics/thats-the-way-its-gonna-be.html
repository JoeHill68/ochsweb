Em       C9            B7        Em
If you say all the good times are gone,
Em      C9                     B7      Em
If you say this rain will keep rainin' on--
AM           D                Em
I'll walk along with my head held high;
     Am      D             G              Em
I'll find a song and I'll sing it to the sky--
Am       D               G           Em
I may be wrong but I'll live 'til I die.
 C                        Am
That's the way it's gonna be.
         B
Wait and see.

Even though you say hard times knock at my door,
Though you say I'll never smile any more--
I just imagine that I'm ten feet tall,
Then if I try I can climb the highest wall,
It doesn't matter if I slip down and fall:
That's the way it's gonna be.
Wait and see.
    Just you wait and see.

Even though you say I've reached the end of my row,
Though you say my times are all running low--
It's been so long since I tried to frown,
That Old Man Trouble will never get me down.
It's all that easy when you know where you're bound.
That's the way it's gonna be.
Wait and see.

Even though you say all the good times are gone,
Though you say this rain will keep rainin' on--
I'll walk along with my head held high;
I'll find a song and I'll sing it to the sky--
I may be wrong but I'll live 'til I die.
That's the way it's gonna be.
Wait and see.
    Just you wait and see.

this song ends on an Em chord

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<P>
(C) 1963 Phil Ochs.
<P>
[NOTES: There are several minor differences between this transcript from the
recording and the wording in the liner notes. 
<P>
   Liner notes have lines starting with "If you say..." throughout, but the
recorded version substitutes "Even though you say" in some of the lines. 
<P>
   Liner notes: "I just imagine that I'm ten feet tall, / And if I try..."
where the recording has "I just imagine that I'm ten feet tall, / Then if I
try...."   --gkorsts@agronomy.org]
