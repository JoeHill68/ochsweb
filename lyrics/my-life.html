<H1>My Life</H1>

INTRO: G / C / D / C / G / C

D  G               D
My life was once a joy to me,
                                    G / C / G  
Never knowing, I was growing, everyday.
D  G               D                     
My life was once a toy to me,
                                  Em
And I wound it and I found it ran away.
Am
So I raced through the night
                  G
with a face at my feet, like a god I would write,
                      F
All the melodies were sweet, and the women were white.
               E                        D
It was easy to survive, my life was so alive.

My life was once a flag to me
And I waved it and behaved like I was told.
My life was once a drag to me
And I loudly, and I proudly, lost control
I was drawn by a dream
I was loved by a lie, every serf on the scene
Begged me to buy.
But I slipped through the scheme
So lucky to fail
My life was not for sale.

My life is now a myth to me
Like the drifter, with his laughter in the dawn.
My life is now a death to me
So I'll mold it and I'll hold it till I'm born
So I turned to the land
Where I'm so out of place
Throw a curse on the plan
In return for the grace
To know where I stand
Take everything I own
Take your tap from my phone
And leave my life alone
My life alone.
