<H1>First Snow</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
First snow on the autumn ground
covers grass where she once lay down
blanket of white, grass out of sight,
Where did she go, tell me first snow.

First snow cover my mistakes
cover the past with your flakes
perfect white sheet, beneath my feet
I hurt her so, cleanse me first snow.

First snow down you dart
cold as the winter, cold as my heart,
fall from the sky, please tell me why
I let her go and lost her first snow.

First snow down you fall
I feel your heartbeat, I hear you call
So I'll lay still, with autumn I go,
Please hurry, first snow.
</PRE>
