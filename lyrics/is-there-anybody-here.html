         D                                                    Bm
Is there anybody here who'd like to change his clothes into a uniform,
         G                       B7                        G       Em  A7
Is there anybody here who thinks they're only serving in a raging storm.
         D                 F#m
Is there anybody here with glory in their eyes,
        D                       F#m
	loyal to the end, whose duty is to die,
          G                  A
I want to see him, I want to wish him luck,
        D                     G
I wanna shake his hand, wanna call his name,
  A                D
Pin a medal on the man.

Is there anybody here who'd like to wrap a flag around an early grave,
Is there anybody here who thinks they're standing taller on a battle wave.
Is there anybody here like to do his part,
	soldier to the world and a hero to his heart,
I want to see him, I want to wish him luck,
I wanna shake his hand, wanna call his name,
Pin a medal on the man.

         Bm           A 
Is there anybody here proud of the parade,
              Bm                        G                   A 
	who'd like to give a cheer and show they're not afraid.
F#7                                    Bm
I'd like like to ask him what he's trying to defend,
E                              A               A7
I'd like to ask him what he thinks he's gonna win.
         D                                                    Bbm
Is there anybody here who thinks that following orders takes away the blame
         G                       B7                     G        Em  A7
Is there anybody here who'd wouldn't mind a murder by another name
         D                  F#m
Is there anybody here whose pride is on the line,
                 D                          F#m
	with the honor of the brave and the courage of the blind,
          G                  A
I want to see him, I want to wish him luck,
        D                     G
I wanna shake his hand, gonna call his name,
  A                 D
Pin a medal on the man.
Medal on the man.
