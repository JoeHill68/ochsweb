<H1>I Dreamed I Saw Phil Ochs Last Night</H1>
<H3>By Billy Bragg</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
i dreamed i saw phil ochs last night
alive as you or me      
says i to phil "you're ten years dead"
"i never died' says he
"i never died" says he

the music business killed you phil 
they ignored the things you said         
and cast you out when fashions changed
says phil "but i ain't dead"
says phil "but i ain't dead"
        
the fbi harassed you phil
they smeared you with their lies
says he "but they could never kill
what they could not compromise
i never compromised"

"though fashion's changed and critics sneered
the songs that i have sung
are just as true tonight as then
        the struggle carries on
        the struggle carries on"

with the song of freedom rings out loud
from valleys and from hills
where people stand up for their rights
phil ochs is with us still
phil ochs inspires us still.
</PRE>

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<p>
words--billy bragg,
music--earl robinson
<p>
The tune is to the song "I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night"
and uncle bill covered Phil's <a href="joe-hill.html">Joe Hill</a>
on Don't Mourn, Organise!
<p>
This song can be found on the album
<a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/releases/albums/internationale/index.html">
The Internationale</a>
<p>
Abigail Plumb tells me ``Will Oldham of Palace
Bros. also does a version of "I Dreamed I Saw Phil Ochs Last Night" but it
is rather different from the Billy Bragg version. Check it out at
http://www.palace.free.fr/paroles/Gezundheit.htm.''
