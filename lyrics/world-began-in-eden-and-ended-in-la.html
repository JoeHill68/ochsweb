Intro:D

D                    G                 D      CCCGGG
Don't you think it's time that we were leaving?
    D               G                 D    CCCGGG
For another chance, another place to start
G                                    F#m
Desperate ones that went across the ocean
         A                              D
And they wondered how it would all turn out.
G              A               D
If you have to beg or steal or borrow
C              D        C            D
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow

They landed on the coldest of the colonies
But still they wanted better than the rich
They built highways on the houses of the homesteads
It happened that way moving west.
If you have to beg or steal or borrow
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow

So this is where the Renaissance has led to
And we will be the only ones to know
So take a drive and breathe the air of ashes
That is, if you need a place to go
If you have to beg or steal or borrow
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow
City of Tomorrow, City of Tomorrow
