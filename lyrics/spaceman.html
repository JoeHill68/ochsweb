[first: the melody by itself, whistled]

Way high, so high:
Travelin' fast and free.
Spaceman, look down:
Tell me what you see.
    Can you see the hunger there
    Strike without a sound?
    Can you see the food you burn
    As you circle round?

Way high, so high:
All the world will cheer.
Spaceman, look down:
Tell me what you hear.
    Can you hear a child cry,
    Body filled with pain?
    Deadly sores when cures are there--
    How much fuel remains?

Way high, so high:
Spaceship made of steel.
Spaceman, look down:
Tell me what you feel.
    Can you feel the money gone
    As you sail through space?
    Can you feel how many die
    When you win the race?

Way high, so high:
Travelin' fast and free.
Spaceman, look down:
Tell me what you see.

[End: first two lines of the melody again, whistled.]
