Intro: C F C

C
I've found my freedom
               F                           C
Her and I been flying down that highway of gold
   F                C          F          C
My shirtsleeves are rolled, my Colt 45 is cold.
          Am                G
I go fast,   till I'm going faster.

        F                                   C      
        Look how far we've come, look how far
                  G                     C
         A car, a car, my kingdom for a car

How I love the highway
Picks me up and takes me whereever I please
I race through the trees bring space to her knees
I am master of all that's flying past me.

	Look how far we've come, look how far
	A car, a car, my kingdom for a car

	Look how far we've come, look how far
	A car, a car, my kingdom for a car

Take me to tomorrow
Let me go on racing with the wind in my hair
There's smoke in the air but I do not care
If you want me, you will have to pass me

	Look how far we've come, look how far.
	A car, a car, my kingdom for a car

Come to me baby,
We will leave this town it was not made for a man
We'll find a new land, but the traffic is jammed
I went far but it's a time for walking

	Look how far we've come, look how far.
	A car, a car, my kingdom for a car
	A car, a car, my kingdom for a car
	A car, a car, my kingdom for a car
