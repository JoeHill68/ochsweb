<H1>How High's the Watergate</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>

How high is the watergate, Mama, she said it's one foot high and risin'
How high is the watergate, Pama, he said it's two feet high and risin'
There's a flood around the poker game (There's a bug on the window pane)
Gerry Ford must be insane
Oh, my God, it's Mickey Spillane,
The tides are risin' (Two feet high and rising)

How high is the watergate, Mama, three feet high and risin'
How high is the watergate, Pama, three feet high and risin'
In the Swiss bank the money's stashed
18 minutes of tapes were slashed
They've even taken in Johnny Cash
Three feet high and rising

How high is the watergate, Mama, four feet high and risin'
How high is the watergate, Pama, four feet high and risin'
Nixon's gone and taught you lies (Nixon doesn't talk, he lies)
A face that screams out for replies (...for a pie)
And the only one workin's is David Frye,
Oh the tides are risin' (four feet high and risin')

How high is the watergate, Mama, five feet high and risin'
How high is the watergate, Pama, five feet high and risin'
If there ever was a crook, he's it
Perversion is the soul of wit
Pack your shovel, he's full of shit,
The tides are risin' (five feet high and risin')

<H4>Notes:</H4>
<P>
I have tried to
reconcile the two versions of the lyrics I have.
One from <CITE>Death Of A Rebel</CITE>
and another from a transcript of 
WPLV Alex Bennett Show,
January 1974
(contributed by GMGough@aol.com)
Where the two conflict the latter is in parethesis.
I should probably reverse this given <CITE>Death Of A Rebel</CITE>s
frequent lyrical mistakes. -- trent

This song is a parody of a Johnny Cash song
<cite>Three Feet High and Rising</cite>.
