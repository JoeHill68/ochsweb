    G              C              G       C       G
The night air is inviting you to walk out on the trail
             Em
You will not fail
Am           D
You will not fail
    G              C             G       C     G
And by the beach a lady sails a ship without a sail
              Em       
And you reach out for her
Am            D
And you reach out for her
     C        D
But, I've had her
C        D
I've had her
      G
She's nothing

Down the cliffs you clamber and you tumble to the shore
The warm waves roar
The warm waves roar
And on the reef a mermaid siren screams one perfume more
And she shouts to you
Through the foam she shouts to you
But, I've had her
I've had her
She's nothing

The players at the party are prepared to take a chance
They drop their pants
They drop their pants
In the corner, she's so crystaline no one dares to ask a dance
And she calls out to you
And she calls out to you
But, I've had her
I've had her
She's nothing

In the prison of your broken bed you dribble in a dream
And find a queen
And find a queen
But your sleep is sadly stolen by the face that is a stream
That's flowing out to you
She's flowing out to you
But, I've had her
I've had her
She's nothing

The vision of the seven veils are racing down the road
signs are slow
The signs are slow
But beauty is the mistress and the beauty you've been told
You'd speed the route for her
You'd speed the route for her
But, I've had her
I've had her
She's nothing

The fog has changed the city to a friendly frightened fawn
The shades are drawn
The shades are drawn
To posess her misty madness you would gladly duel the dawn
And fade out to her
And fade out to her
But, I've had her
I've had her
She's nothing

The circus clown, he hides a tear beneath his pained smile
And charms a child
And charms a child
While the dancing girls and prancing horse blows kisses down the aisle
You'd roll about for her
You'd roll about for her
But, I've had her
I've had her
She's nothing

All alone, the flaming field, your fairy love is spread
Your time has fled
Your time has fled
Now the only way to touch her is the gun beside your head
Now there's now doubt for her
Now there's now doubt for her
But, I've had her
I've had her
She's nothing
