<H1>Hazard, Kentucky</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>

Well, some people think that Unions are too strong,
Union leaders should go back where they belong;
But I wish that they could see a little more of poverty
And they might start to sing a different song.

    Well, minin' is a hazard in Hazard, Kentucky,
    And if you ain't minin' there,
    Well, my friends, you're awful lucky,
    'Cause if you don't get silicosis or pay that's just atrocious
    You'll be screamin' for a Union that will care.

Well, let's look at old Kentucky for a while.
It's hard to find a miner who will smile.
Well, the Constitution's fine, but it's hard reading in the mines,
and when welfare stops, the trouble starts to pile.

    Well, minin' is a hazard in Hazard, Kentucky,
    And if you ain't minin' there,
    Well, my friends, you're awful lucky,
    'Cause if you don't get silicosis or pay that's just atrocious
    You'll be screamin' for a Union that will care.

Well, the Depression was ended with the war,
But nobody told Kentucky, that is sure.
Some are living in a sewer while the jobs are getting fewer
But more coal is mined than ever was before.

    Well, minin' is a hazard in Hazard, Kentucky,
    And if you ain't minin' there,
    Well, my friends, you're awful lucky,
    'Cause if you don't get silicosis or pay that's just atrocious
    You'll be screamin' for a Union that will care.

Well, the badge of Sheriff Combs always shines
And when duty calls he seldom ever whines.
Well, I don't like raisin' thunder, but it sort of makes you wonder
When he runs the law and also runs the mines.

    Well, minin' is a hazard in Hazard, Kentucky,
    And if you ain't minin' there,
    Well, my friends, you're awful lucky,
    'Cause if you don't get silicosis or pay that's just atrocious
    You'll be screamin for a Union that will care.

Well, our standard of living is highest all around,
But our standard of giving is the lowest when you're down,
So give a yell and a whistle when they light that Union missile
And we'll lift our feet up off the ground.

    Well, minin' is a hazard in Hazard, Kentucky,
    And if you ain't minin' there,
    Well, my friends, you're awful lucky,
    'Cause if you don't get silicosis or pay that's just atrocious
    You'll be screamin for a Union that will care.
