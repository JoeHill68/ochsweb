D    G       A
Niko mchunga ngombe		        (I take care of cows)
D    G       A
Niko mchunga ngombe		        (I take care of cows)
G
Sasa sasa				(Now now)
A      D
Twende mbele				(Let's go ahead)

Chakula haina taabu			(Food is no problem)
Tunana mbuzi tunakula 		        (We kill goats and we eat)
Niko mchunga ngombe		        (I take care of cows)
Sasa sasa				(Now now)
Twende mbele				(Let's go ahead)

Nguo haina taabu			(Clothes are no problem)
Tunauza ngombe sokomi		        (We sell cows at the market)
Taabu tunavumilia			(Problems...we perservere)
Niko mchunga ngombe		        (I take care of cows)
Sasa sasa				(Now now)
Twende mbele				(Let's go ahead)

Maisha hapita				(Life will pass)
Sisi tutazeeka				(We will get old)
Natoto wangu watalinda ngombe 	        (My children will take care of the cows)
Niko mchunga ngombe		        (I take care of cows)
Sasa sasa				(Now now)
Twende mbele				(Let's go ahead)

Havunjika kivulini			(I will rest in the shadow)
Na pombe karibu yangu		        (And beer next to me)
Niko mchunga ngombe		        (I take care of cows)
Sasa sasa				(Now now)
Twende mbele				(Let's go ahead)

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<P>
This song was recorded in 1973 in Kenya with the Pan African Ngembo
Rumba Band.
The song is written in Lingala.
On the original single, Dijiba and Bukasa (whoever they might be)
are co-credited with writing the song.
<p>
The transcription and translation are thanks to: a. omar, k. lunvuna
and zuni migozi.  And, of course Dave Cohen who posted them.
<p>
the "mchunga" is correct in the lyrics to Niko
(mchumba actually means sweetheart/fiance)
