<H1>Sing Along With Me</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>
When times are bad and you're feeling sad
Got more troubles than you've ever had
There's one sure way to make you feel glad
the whole world will come to you
here's all you gotta do: just walk right through that door.
	Sing a song when things go wrong
	Of a tune you'll be smiling soon
	Find yourself a melody, sing along with me.

When troubles are out and you're feeling down
You can chase those troubles away
send your blues back to yesterday
It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor
Walk right through that door.
*chorus*

And when your own true love is giving you pain
makes you ride that lonesome train
feel like you're going in sane
whistle that true love from your mind
leave her far behind.
*chorus*
