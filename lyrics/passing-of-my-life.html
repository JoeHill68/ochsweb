<PRE>

G
I've seen rivers red with blood,
          C                   G
I've seen valleys filled with mud;
G                          A7             D
I've seen stormy seas that pound upon the shore.
G
I've seen mountains strewn with bones,
          C              G 
I've seen people without homes,
G                     D             Em
And it's all with the passing of my life.

I've seen highways headin' down,
I've seen green grass turn to brown;
I've seen forests burn a couple days or more.
I've seen prairies filled with holes,
I've seen good men sell their souls,
And it's all with the passing of my life.

        D                        G    G/F#    Em
    And as I see the fury of the fire and the flame
      A7                         D
    I wonder if my children will have to see the same.

I've seen rockets all ablaze,
I've seen dark and deadly days;
I've seen cities bombed and butchered to the ground.
I've seen battles by the score,
I've seen ten too many wars,
And it's all with the passing of my life.

    And as I see the fury of the fire and the flame
    I wonder if my children will have to see the same.

I've seen rockets all ablaze,
I've seen dark and deadly days;
I've seen cities bombed and butchered to the ground.
I've seen battles by the score,
I've seen ten too many wars,
And it's all with the passing of my life --
Yes, it's all with the passing of my life.
