Am        G               Am
If I knew why the sun did shine
Am                G                Am
And If I knew the taste of ancient wine
F                   G                C                  Am
If I knew all these wonders, there's one thing more I'd know
F            G                 Am
I'd know the way we all should go

If I knew the deepest ocean floor
And If I knew the waves upon the shore
If I knew all these wonders, there's one thing more I'd know
I'd know the way we all should go

G                             Am
If I knew the seasons and the wisdom of the years
G                          Am
I'd know the reason we are here

If I knew the power of the Lord
And where the gifts of heaven may be stored
If I knew all these wonders, there's one thing more I'd know
I'd know the way we all should go

If I knew the seasons and the wisdom of the years
I'd know the reason we are here

If I knew the power of the Lord
And where the gifts of heaven may be stored
If I knew all these wonders, there's one thing more I'd know
I'd know the way we all should go
