Religon!
In the town of Bethlehem many years ago
a man got religion and he changed the staus quo
He went around the countryside preaching brotherhood
and anyone who heard him, they knew and understood
	Where there's a will there's a way
        That's what I always say
        We gotta make a try,
        Come on, it's do or die.

Civil Rights!
John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave
but in this land of freedom you will never find a slave   
He fought for a cause, the cause of liberty
and if he heard this slogan, I am sure he would agree.
*chorus*
 
Patriotism!
Well there once were thirteen colonies that wanted to be free
they held a couple of meetings, they knew what had had to be
they picked a man named Washington to lead them into battle
He said: If we win, some day we'll have a World's Fair at Seattle.
*chorus*

And A Message!
Well in this troubled world of ours we face another threat,
these nuclear explosions, they're gonna kill us yet,
A-Bomb, H-Bomb, Neutron-Bomb, we must destroy them all,
we have got to rise together, or together we will fall.
*chorus*
