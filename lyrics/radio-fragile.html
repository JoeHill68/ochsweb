<H3>Notes:</H3>
<p>
We all said you'd never make it
Cuz you had that fragile heart
And you were odd within the ways of the social
You through a caution to us all
And now when the late night drinkers
gather for their falls
Someone says they've seen you out there
laughing at us all

You mourned the cause of discontent
with those who couldn't loose the dark
From the broad of daylight to half spent stars . . .
Just waiting dusk to fall
Tell me, what the hell were you saying?
Was there a point to it all?
Oh, and did they really see you out there . . .

(chorus)
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Oh, were you really out there . . .
Laughing at us all?

The midnight boy from Minnesota
shut you down and stole the show
They say that you were bitter in your anguish
Cuz it was you they ought to hold
You wore your causes on your sleeve
like a beacon wears the dark
It's only right you should be out there
laughing at us all

Now you are only dust for art
You're a shadow to recall
For all of those late night drinkers
in their ragged lonely bars
And we all said you'd never make it
cuz you had that fragile heart
Now, all our hearts you held are wasted
you're out there laughing at us all . . .

(repeat chorus twice)
