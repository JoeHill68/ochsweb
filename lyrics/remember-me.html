      D                          A
Oh, I am the Unknown Soldier who died in World War Two.
  G                                D                 G
I didn't want to fight, it was the only thing to do.
                      D
I was the victim of a world that went insane--
         G              D      A      D
Will you show me that I didn't die in vain.

             G                          D
    Remember me, when the crosses are a burnin',
             A                          D
    Remember me, when the racists come around.
             G                               D
    Remember me, when the tides of peace are turnin',
             A      G            D   A  D
    Remember me and please don't let me down.

On the South Pacific Islands and the Iwo Jima sands
We raised the flag of freedom over many distant lands
And every time I killed a man my own heart felt the pain--
Will you show me that I didn't die in vain.

    Remember me, when the crosses are a burnin',
    Remember me, when the racists come around.
    Remember me, when the tides of peace are turnin',
    Remember me and please don't let me down.

And I carried my old rifle to the European shore
And every friend that died made me die a little more.
Have pity on the man who put a bullet through my brain
And show me that I didn't die in vain.

    Remember me, when the crosses are a burnin',
    Remember me, when the racists come around.
    Remember me, when the tides of peace are turnin',
    Remember me and please don't let me down.

When the Fascists started marching many millions had to pay;
We saw them rise to power but we looked the other way.
It happened once before and it can happen once again--
Will you show me that I didn't die in vain.

    Remember me, when the crosses are a burnin',
    Remember me, when the racists come around.
    Remember me, when the tides of peace are turnin',
    Remember me and please don't let me down.

racists come around."

Phil Ochs plays it; I think I
transponed it one note down, but this is a way it can be played."
