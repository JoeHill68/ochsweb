<H1>It's Been A Long, Long Story</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>
It's been a long, long, long, long story
'bout the fight to make men free,
It's been a long, long, long, long story
about as long as a story ought to be
	So hold your hats boys, hold the fort
        I'm here to make a long story short
        so it's time to sail in to the port
        Time to make a long story short.

It's been...........
about the fight to make the Union grow
It's been............
Story that's been told too slow.
*chorus*

It's been............
about the fight to ban the bomb
It's been..............
Should have been a long time gone.
*chorus*

It's been..........
about the fight to keep the hungry lands
It's been............
about as long as a hungry world can stand.
*chorus*
