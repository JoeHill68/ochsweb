<PRE>

Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies,
You're the gals for me.
Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies,
I'll keep you company.

You can have your Marilyn, your Carolyn, your Jacqueline.
Grace Kelly never meant that much to me--
Just give me:
    Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies,
    You're the gals for me. (I'll give you secrets.)
    And you're the gals for me.

Oh, you get good defense from Robert McNamara--
Defends us all day long;
But when Lord Profumo takes off his mascara
You know he can't go wrong.

Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Lord and Lady Astor:
Everybody's gonna lose their minds
Because of:
    Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies,
    Will you be mine, all mine? (I'll take your pictures.)
    Will you be mine, all mine?

</PRE>

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<p>
The tune for this song was taken from "Walk Right In" by the Rooftop Singers.
<P>
(C) 1963 Phil Ochs.

[NOTES: Sure, someone could look up the details of this one-among-many
British aristocracy-spies-and-sex scandal, but basically this song is, IMHO,
just a lovely piece of topical fluff and fun.   --gkorsts@agronomy.org]
<p>
I got a correction about this song from Tom Drake: "John Profumo was
never a Lord or an aristocrat. I know because we used to fly him
around in our Air Corps helicopter in the 60's."
