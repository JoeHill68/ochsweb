G                                        D7
Everything is going wrong, everything is bad
                                               G
There's no one I can talk to when I am feeling sad
She broke my heart a million ways
                  C
I'm losing all my friends
                     G       D7                G
The boys down at the factory ask me where I've been
C
Fill 'er up with love
                  G
Please won't you, mister?
         D7                        G
Just the hi-test is what I used to say
    C                         G
But that was before I lost my baby
                              D7            /G
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today

I never should have left my home, never left the farm
But the city was exciting it couldn't do me any harm
The more folks I run across, the less I seem to know
The days go by too quickly the nights go by too slow.
Fill 'er up with love
Please won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say
But that was before I lost my baby
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today

I cannot face another girl, I believe I'll turn to drink
So I won't remember, so I won't have to think
Tomorrow will bring happiness or, at least, another day
So I will bid farewell and I'll be on my way
Fill 'er up with love
Please won't you, mister?
Just the hi-test is what I used to say
But that was before I lost my baby
I'll have a dollar's worth of regular today
