<H1>I'll Be There</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>

When the river of rebellion overflows, I'll be there
When the seed of discontent plants and grows, I'll be there
Watching for the sun through the dark and rainy storm
Searching for the keys to the dungeons old and worn
Let me tell you, I'll be there

When the shadow of the tyrant falls and sweeps across the land
When men would steal from others with paper in their hand
When people search for answers and the answers never come
When their troubles would be over if they thought and fought as one
Let me tell you, I'll be there

Whispering of yesterday has grown into a roar
Winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore
When the time is ready and the call is loud and clear
Let me tell you, I'll be there

When the thunder of opression roars and crackles, I'll be there
When those who would be free are wearing shackles, I'll be there
For the day is gonna come when they'll throw away their chains
Lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains
And let me tell you, I'll be there

Whispering of yesterday has turned into a roar
Winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore
When the time is ready and the call is loud and clear
Let me tell you, I'll be there

When the thunder of opression roars and crackles, I'll be there
When those who would be free are wearing shackles, I'll be there
For the day is gonna come when they'll throw away their chains
Lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains
And let me tell you
Let me tell you
Let me tell you
Let me tell you, I'll be there

Maybe this is obvious, but do I hear echoes of Tom Joad?
