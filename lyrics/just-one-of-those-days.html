<H1>Just One Of Those Days</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
You know I woke up this morning and my head was sore
From too many good times from the night before
So I got out of bed and I stumbled on the floor
And I had to say
	just one of those days,
	just one of those years,
	just one of those lifetimes

And the rain was falling down from the sky
Didn't have a raincoat for to keep me dry
The cars were laughing as they went splashing by
And I had to say
	just one of those days,
	just one of those years,
	just one of those lifetimes

So walked down the road saw a ticket on my car
And the weather was cold, and she wouldn't start
You know with two flat tires you can't go far
So I had to say
	just one of those days,
	just one of those years,
	just one of those lifetimes

Then somebody pushed me, said "get out of my way"
I didn't do no crime but I had to pay.
You know I whistled at a girl, she ran the other way
And I had to say
	just one of those days,
	just one of those years,
	just one of those lifetimes

Repeat verse 1
