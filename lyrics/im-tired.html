E                          G#m
Sometime's I feel that the world isn't mine
C#m                       F          B
It feeds on my hunger and tears on my time
        E
And I'm tired,
         C#m
Yes, I'm tired
      E                        G#m
Every face on the street is as cold the air
   C#m                  F               B
As hard as the pavement moves 'neath my feet
        E
And I'm tired,
         C#m
Yes, I'm tired

C#m                  B
Sometimes I stop and ask to myself
   C#m          B      C#m
Oh why should I be so alone
C#m
It comes and it goes
    B
and nobody knows
            C#m          B              C#m
For they're blind with a pain all their own
     E                      G#m
So I start out again with a smile on my face
   C#m                    F            B
To hide all the empty and search for a friend
        E
And I'm tired 
         C#m
Yes, I'm tired
C#m                  B
Sometimes I stop and ask to myself
   C#m          B      C#m
Oh why should I be so alone
C#m
It comes and it goes
    B
and nobody knows
            C#m          B              C#m
For they're blind with a pain all their own
     E                      G#m
So I start out again with a smile on my face
   C#m                    F            B
To hide all the empty and search for a friend
        E
And I'm tired 
         C#m
Yes, I'm tired
        E
And I'm tired 
         C#m
Yes, I'm tired
