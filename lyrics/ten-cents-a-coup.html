<H1>Ten Cents a Coup</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<PRE>
G
It was a used car dealers' election
        A
And the choice was rather small
    D7
The boys agreed, "it's the war we need,
                           G
So there's no president at all."
G                   E
Here's to Nixon and Agnew
             A
They are the stars of the stage and screen
D7
Not since Laurel and Hardy
                       G
Have I laughed so hard I screamed

I thought that Johnson was the devil
I thought we couldn't do no worse
Now the White House stands in Disneyland
This country must be under a curse
Here's to Nixon and Agnew
They are the stars of the stage and screen
Not since Laurel and Hardy
Have I laughed so hard I screamed

I dreamed that Nixon died of a suntan
There was only Spiro left
At his swearing in, he fell on his chin
He assasinated himself.
Here's to Nixon and Agnew
They are the stars of the stage and screen
Not since Laurel and Hardy
Have I laughed so hard I screamed
