<PRE>

     G    B7        Em   Am7   D7            G
Oh I laid down your railroads, every mile of track.
                 B7    Em  Am7     D7            G    
With the muscles on my arm and the sweat upon my back.
G7  C                  G             C             G
And now the trains are rolling, they roll to every shore
    C               G                     A7               D
You tell me that my job is through, there ain't no work no more.
         G    B7        Em Am7   D7           G
Though I laid down your highways all across the land.
                 B7     Em    Am7     D7          G
With the ringing of the steel and the power of my hands.
G7  C       G                    C              G
And now the roads are there like ribbons in the sky,
    C               G                  A7             D
You tell me that my job is through but still I wonder why.

        Em                     Bm
For the wages were low and the hours were long
        Em                     D7
And the labour was all I could bear.
           Em                      Bm
Now you've got new machines for to take my place
        Am7                      D7
And you tell me it's not mine to share.
         G    B7        Em  Am7       D7             G
Though I laid down your factories and laid down your fields,
             B7     Em     Am7    D7           G
With my feet on the ground and my back to your wheels.
G7  C                G           C              G
And now the smoke is rising, the steel is all a-glow,
    C              G                D7            G
I'm walking down a jobless road and where am I to go.

(repeat)

Em      Am       D7    G
Tell me, where am I to go.
