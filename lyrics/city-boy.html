G
I'm just a city boy
         C
Born and bred
        Am               D
It's a city life I've led
G                Em
My pasture was a street
     C               Cm
I've never climbed a tree
    G                     D
But that's all right with me
             G        D
'Cause I'm a city boy

I'm just a city boy
Born and raised
From these rooftops I have gazed
Where the grass was made of steel
I've never plowed a field
Until the pavement starts to peel
I'll be a city boy

I'm just a city boy
Born and grown
That's all I've ever known
Where the lights would greet the dawn
There's a factory for a farm
Sure the city has its charm
When you're a city boy

</PRE>
