<H1>A.M.A. Song</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
G           D           G  
We are the nation's physicians
                     D             G
Yes, we give to our lobbies every day
                       D                B                C7
We will fight against disease when the money comes with ease
      G            D         G
And when we get together we say
    C          G
Hooray for A.M.A.
     C               G              D
And for us doctors gluts of higher pay
        G               D              B                  C7
If you can't afford my bill don't you tell me that you're ill
        G              D           G   
'Cause that's the free enterprise way

We've divided up the sections of the body
Every day we specialize more and more
But we really love to stitch the diseases of the rich
We are sure there is a clinic for the poor
Hooray for the A.M.A
And for us doctors gluts of higher pay
If you can't afford my bill don't you tell me that you're ill
'Cause that's the free enterprise way

And our waiting rooms are getting pretty crowded
It is sad to see our patients sit and bleed
But if you must use our ointment then you must have an appointment
Or who'll pay for those magazines you read
Hooray for the A.M.A
And for us doctors gluts of higher pay, higher pay
If you can't afford my bill don't you tell me that you're ill
'Cause that's the free enterprise way

And now the government is getting too ambitious
Yes, we know they want to socialize us all
Well our oath was hippocratic but with money we're fanatic
So we'll see you in Canada in the fall [1]
Hooray for the A.M.A.
And for us doctors gluts of higher pay
If you can't afford my bill don't you tell me that you're ill
'Cause that's the free enterprise way
AMALGAMATED A.M.A.

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<P>
1.  At the time this song was written (circa 1962) Canada did not
have socialized medicine.  That's probably the <strong>only</strong>
part of this song you could call dated.
<P>
This was one of Phil's more popular songs when he sang at Faragher's,
a coffeehouse in Cleveland Heights in 1961.
<P>
It was published in Broadside, issue #21 in February 1963.
