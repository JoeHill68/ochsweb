<PRE>
A                                D             A
Went to a party the other night, everybody was there
                     D                  E
Thought that I would have some fun as I started up the stair.
A                         D
Somebody tried to ruin it when he won a raffle prize,
A                           E
Tried to shake and shock us right before our eyes.
         D     E                   A
While we danced, while we were dancing
D           A              E             F#m
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?

It was filled with the finest cheeses filled with imported wine,
Wish that I had won it, and I wish that it were mine
I know some wino lives outside of town
Hw would gladly cut your throat if he could drink it down
While we danced, while we were dancing
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?

If I had found out who he was, if I'd have found his face,
Next time we have a party gonna find out his name.
I've been on the ocean swimming know poroise led the way,
It wasn't worth the matter and it wasn't worth the pay. 
We were there, go right on dancing
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?

How can I go swimming now my world is laid to waste?
It was the worst of manners and it was the worst of taste
Why can't we be left alone? Think that it was a crime
If everyone was groovy we could all have a real good time.
We could dance, go right on dancing
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>
This song is based on a real incident, summarized here by Dave Cohen:
<blockquote>
Phil was attending a party at tommy smother's house
(in honor of Donovan, i think)
part of the party was a raffle
for a basket filled with wine, cheese, fruit, etc.
Phil won the basket
and proceeded to make a speech (more or less)
about the absurdity of beautiful people partying
in the Hollywood hills, while in Vietnam...
(much to the dismay of host T. Smothers)
then Phil threw the gift basket in the pool
(to a mixed aaudience reaction)
</blockquote>
(more details in <cite>There but for Fortune</cite>, p. 217 (end of
chapter 11).
