<H1>One More Parade</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs and Bob Gibson</H3>

<PRE>
Dm
Hup, two, three, four, marching down the street
C                            Dm
Rolling of the drums and the trampin' of the feet
                    Dm
Generals salute and mothers wave and weep(?)
F              E7    A   - G
Here comes the big parade
           A   - G
Don't be afraid
         A7
Price is paid
    Dm
One more parade

   F                    C
So young, so strong, so ready for the war
Dm                  A
So willing to die upon a foreign shore
Gm                       A              C
All march together, everybody looks the same
F           E7             A   - G
So there is no one you can blame
          A
Don't be ashamed
G          A7
Light the flame
    Dm   A7 Dm
One more parade

Listen for the sound and listen for the noise
Listen for the thunder of the marching boys
A few years ago their guns were only toys
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid
Price is paid
One more parade

So young, so strong, so ready for the war
So willing to die upon a foreign shore
All march together, everybody looks the same
So there is no one you can blame
Don't be ashamed
Light the flame
One more parade

Medals on their coats and guns in their hands
Trained to kill as they're trained to stand
10,000 ears need only one command
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid
Price is paid
One more parade

So young, so strong, so ready for the war
So willing to die upon a foreign shore
All march together, everybody looks the same
So there is no one you can blame
Don't be ashamed
Light the flame
One more parade

Cold hard stares on faces ? so proud
Kisses from the girls and cheers from the crowd
And the widows from the last war cry into their shroud
Here comes the big parade
Don't be afraid
Price is paid
Don't be ashamed
War is a game
World in flames
So start the parade

Pam Raver says:
Phil wrote "One More Parade" in Cleveland one night when he was emceeing a
performance by the late Bob Gibson. He caught a guitar riff which he played
for Gibson after the show and it became those decending bass notes that
march through much of the song.
