<H1>Time Was </H1>
<H3>by Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>

Time was when a man could live alone
A man could build a home, have a family of his own
The peaceful years would flow, he could watch his children grow
 	But it was a long time ago.

	Time was when troubles were few
	When there weren't so many people to tell you what to do.
	It was a long time ago.

Time was when a man could have his land,
He could farm it with his hands, he was free to make a stand
He could live a life of toil, with his future in the soil,
	But it was a long time ago.

	Time was when troubles were few
	When there weren't so many people to tell you what to do.
	It was along time ago.

Time was when a man could have his pride,
There was justice on his side, and there was no need to hide,
The world was far away, there was truth in every day,
	But it was along time ago.

	Time was when troubles were few
	When there weren't so many people to tell you what to do.
	It was along time ago.

(repeat third verse)
