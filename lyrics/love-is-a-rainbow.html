<H1>Love Is A Rainbow</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
And love is a rainbow curving down from the sky
Falling crystals of colour, shades of warm that never die
Red melodies burning still lead me to the night
And sing about the sights that they are sighing
Silver shadows returning, dazzle with desire
now freezing in a fire, they are flying

And love is a rainbow curving down from the sky
Falling crystals of colour, shades of warm that never die
Brown cascades are flowing, tinged upon your skin
Like strings of violins they are playing
Green breezes are blowing, cooling songs of tone
Now dancing in a moan as they are swaying

And love is a rainbow curving down from the sky
Falling crystals of colour, shades of warm that never die
Oh the yellow of the flowers, petals everywhere
Showing how to share the dreams of dawning
Blue fades in the hours, swallowed by the wine
To still the hands of time until the moring

And love is a rainbow curving down from the sky
Falling crystals of colour, shades of warm that never die
