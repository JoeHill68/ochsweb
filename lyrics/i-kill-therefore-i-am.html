Intro : G F C D

G                F        C          D
Meet the king of cowboys, he rides a pale pony
G             F        C           D             B
He fights the bad boys brings them to their knees
                                 C
He patrols the highways from the air
D                              Em
He keeps the country safe from long hair
Bb         F                G
I am the masculine american man
  D         C      D C D 
I kill therefore I am.

I don't like the black man, for he doesn't know his place
Take the back of my hand or I'll spray you with my mace
I'm as brave as any man can be
I find my courage through chemistry
I am the masculine american man
I kill therefore I am.

I don't like the students now, they don't have no respect
They don't like to work now, I think I'll wring their necks
They call me pig, although I'm underpaid
I'll show those faggots that I'm not afraid
I am the masculine american man
I kill therefore I am.

Farewell to the gangsters we don't need them anymore
We've got the police force, they're the ones who break the law
He's got a gun and he's a hater
He shoots first, he shoots later
I am the masculine american man
I kill therefore I am.
