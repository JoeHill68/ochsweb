<h1>Sailors and Soldiers</h1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>

<pre>
Sailors and soldiers
uniformed shoulders
they're growing older
over the sea

The troops they are leaving
firmly believing
no reason for greiving

Far from the banners,
Far from the glamour,
Far from the planners,
Who sent them to die

herded like cattle
they head for the battle
their rifles will rattle
over the sea

Too young to be shaving
yet the flags they are waving
for the fury they are braving
over the sea

proudly parading
with their medals they are
but their glory is fading
over the sea

Sailors and soldiers
Sailors and soldiers
Sailors and soldiers
