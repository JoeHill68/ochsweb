<PRE>

      C      Em       Am   G7       C          Em    An  G7
Come and take a walk with me thru this green and growing land
C     Em      Am      G7      Gm7       Gm6     Dm
Walk thru the meadows and the mountains and the sand
Dm7  Dm6      Dm              Dm7    Dm6     Dm
Walk thru the valleys and the rivers and the plains
F                     G
Walk thru the sun and walk thru the rain

 Am                      Em
  Here is a land full of power and glory
 Am                          G7
  Beauty that words cannot recall
         C                        Em
  Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom
      Am                     G7   |       C  F  C &amp;--final ending
  Her glory shall rest on us all  (on us all)

From Colorado, Kansas, and the Carolinas too
Virginia and Alaska, from the old to the new
Texas and Ohio and the California shore
Tell me, who could ask for more?

Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor
Only as free as the padlocked prison door
Only as strong as our love for this land
Only as tall as we stand

[ extra verse supplied by Sonny Ochs ]

But our land is still troubled by men who have to hate
They twist away our freedom & they twist away our fate
Fear is their weapon and treason is their cry
We can stop them if we try
