Intro: Dm G Dm G

Dm              G        Dm             G
All around this country, trouble in the air
Bb             Am     F       C7
And I hear the voices calling me
        F      Bb       F      Dm
Asking "do you know and do you care?
Bb              C7     F      F7
Do you know and do you care?"

Bb                       F        F7
So I'm a-gonna do what I have to do
Bb                 F   F7
Say what I have to say
    Bb        Am        F       C7
And I'm gonna be what I have to be
    F              Bb   F        Dm
Now won't you come on along with me?
Bb             C7         F
Won't you come along with me?

Don't want to cause no sorrow
Don't want to cause no pain
I'm only gonna cause what I have to cause
until this land is free of shame
'til this land is free of shame

So I'm a-gonna do what I have to do
Say what I have to say
And I'm gonna be what I have to be
Now won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?

Only one thing I know, I know we're not alone
Was a million here before we came
Be a million when we're gone, we're gone
Million when we're gone

So I'm a-gonna do what I have to do
Say what I have to say
And I'm gonna be what I have to be
Now won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?

Oh, I'm afraid of trouble, yes I'm afraid of jail
But I'm more afraid, lord, not to try
More afraid of what happens, now, if we fail
What happens now if we fail

So I'm a-gonna do what I have to do
Say what I have to say
And I'm gonna be what I have to be
Now won't you come on along with me?
Won't you come along with me?
