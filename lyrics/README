This is my collection of Phil Ochs Lyrics.  I would say that this is
almost all of his lyrics.  Many thanks to all who have contributed.

I have started adding annotations to many songs since some of the
topics have become dated (i.e. who was William Moore?)
Contributions are needed for this effort.

I have fixed up this index so it indicates which songs I do not
yet have lyrics for, which songs are not on any albums, which ones
have chords, notes about the songs, or unclear lyrics. 

Please send any corrections, additions or annotations
to trent@cs.pdx.edu.  ++thanks.
