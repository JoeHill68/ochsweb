E
I can see him coming

He's walking down the highway

With his big boots on

And his big thumb out
             A
He wants to get me

He wants to hurt me
         E/A/B A  E
He wants bring me down
    C#m
But Sometime later when I'm feel a little straighter

I will come across a stranger

Who'll remind me of the danger
    A - B             E
And then I'll run him over
A               E
Pretty smart on my part
D         A                - E
Find my way home in the dark

I can see her coming
sure looks pretty
her breasts are bold
and her mouth is large
she wants to get me
she wants to hurt me
she wants to bring me down
But sometime later when I feel a little naked
I'll lead her to altar
Then I'll tie her all in leather
Then I'm gonna whip her
Pretty smart on my part
Find my way home in the dark

I can see him coming
he's walking through bedroom
with a switchblade knife
He's looking at my wife
he wants to get me
he wants to hurt me
he wants to bring me down
But sometime later when I feel a little braver
I'll go hunting with my rifle
where the wild geese are flying
then I'm gonna bag one
Pretty smart on my part
Find my way home in the dark

I can see them coming
they're training in the mountains
and they talk chinese
and they spread disease
They want to get me
They want to hurt me
They want bring me down
But sometime later when I feel a little safer
We'll assasinate the president
And take over the government
And then we're going to fry them
Pretty smart on my part
Find my way home in the dark
