<h1>New Town</h1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<p>

<pre>
The Road goes straight to the town I'm headed for 
Pretty cold town that I never seen before
I've trouble on my mind hope this new town will be kind
New people and a new job is what I need to find 

New Town, New Town now don't you let me down
I've traveled seven hundred miles 
To be where I am bound
New Town, New Town I'd like a chance to stay
Leave behind the old town and live a brand new way (leave it far away?)

My life isn't easy as I hear the New Town call
You're headin for a future or you're ridin for a fall
And all through the day I can hear the old town say
You can't beat your troubles if you run the other way 

(chorus)

Time is dragging as the road stretches on
And while the wheels are turning, my past is further on (gone?)
And as the trees are going by I wonder what I'll do
And why I left the old town to gamble with a new

(chorus)

New town New town now don't you let me down
I've travelled seven hundred miles 
to be where I am bound
New town new town I'd like a chance to stay
Leave behind the old town and live a brand new way

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<P>
Lyrics supplied by James Barnett and William Curtis, transcribed from
the Four Seasons album <cite>Born To Wonder</cite>
<p>
I was told that this song was found on a demo tape
(along with <a href="smash-flop-hits.html">Smash Flop Hits</a>) by a
former New York City DJ.
Apparently, Phil after hours used the radio studio to 
make a demo tape of some of his songs.
