C            G       D
What's that I hear now ringing in my ear
G            C         G       D
I've heard that sound before
C            G       D
What's that I hear now ringing in my ear
G            C         G       D
I hear it more and more
G                   D
It's the sound of freedom calling
G                      D
Ringing up to the sky
G               D
It's the sound of the old ways falling
C       G     C        D
You can hear it if you try
           C               G     C        D
You can hear it if you try

What's that I see now shining in my eyes
I've seen that light before
What's that I see now shining in my eyes
I see it more and more
It's the light of freedom shining
Shining up to the sky
It's the light of the old ways a dying
You can see it if you try

What's that I feel now beating in my heart
I've felt that beat before
What's that I feel now beating in my heart
I feel it more and more
It's the rumble of freedom calling
Climbing up to the sky
It's the rumble of the old ways a falling
You can feel it if you try
