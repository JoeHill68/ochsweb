<H1>The Ballad Of Alferd Packer</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
In the state of Colorado
In the year of seventy-four
They crossed the San Juan Mountains
Growing hungry to the core.
Their guide was Alferd Packer
And they trusted him too long:
For his character was weak
And his appetite was strong.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Along the Gunnison River
An Indian camp they spied.
An Indian chief approached them,
To stop them he did try.
He warned them of the danger
In the snow that lay around,
But the danger was in Packer,
For his hunger knew now bound.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Two cold months went slowly by;
Packer came back alone.
"My comrades they all froze to death,
I'm starving," he did moan.
The Indian chief knew how he lied,
He spat upon the ground,
For Packer's belly hung out all over his belt:
He'd gained some thirty pounds.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Well for nine long years he ran away
But finally he was tried.
He claimed he didn't kill them,
He only ate their hide.
That County had six dem-o-crats
Until that man arrived.
Well only one lives on today:
He ate the other five.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Eighteen years he stayed in jail,
It was a dreadful fate,
For he suffered indigestion
Every time he ate.
Still, it's hard to blame this hungry guy
Who went searchin' for the mines,
For when he ate his friends
He'd never heard of Duncan Hines.

Here are some further notes about this song by <a

<p>
Not too long ago I brought up the controversy regarding Alfred/Alferd
Packer.  There was much response, except one person on this list sent
me a message suggesting that Phil was dyslexic. I find this hard to
believe as there seems to be no other examples of this sort in his
lyrics that I am aware of nor is it mentioned in either of his
biographies. Perhaps Sonny can comment on this.
<p>
However, the whole "Is it Alfred or Alferd" question intrigued me so I
decided to do some research. For those who are unaware of the
controversy let
me elaborate:
<p>
In 1964 Phil wrote "Ballad of Alfred Packer". This was published in
issue #48 of Broadside. In that issue there is a cartoon showing what
appears to be politicians (Republicans?) celebrating the fact that
Alfred Packer had eaten "five Democrats". The song was not released on
any of Phil's albums, but was included on the Broadside Tapes 1 album
where it is listed under the title of "Ballad of Alferd Packer". I
noticed this and realized there must be some mistake because it was
published with the name Alfred 25 years before in Broadside. I also
remember the 8 months I lived in Boulder, Colorado in 1973 where I
used to hear stories of Alfred Packer. So I started to search out
other information to settle the dispute. I found an article in a 1977
New York Post describing an incident that occurred in the U.S. Department
of Agriculture where a plaque dedicated to Alferd Packer was removed
from the cafeteria wall. The plaque offended some, whereas its removal
offended others.
<p>
I did a search on the internet and came up with the following: There
is an annual Alfred Packer 50 mile hike in Denver; there is an Alfred
Packer barbecue cookoff held every May in Gunnison, Colorado. However,
I also found a trail mix sold in Colorado called "Alferd Packer
Gorp". I also found that someone actually wrote a musical play called
"Alferd Packer: Story of Gold and Cannibals".
<p>
Today I found the following on page 83 of the Encyclopedia of Frontier
Biographies: Alferd Packer was born 1842 in Pennsyvania. He was a
shoemaker by trade. He served in the Union Army, but was discharged in
1862 for a "disability". He prospected in the west. In November 1873
he left Utah for Colorado with 21 men. When the party became
snowbound, Al and five others left the main group to search for
aid. Packer reached the Los Pinos Indian Agency on April 16,
1874. Upon questioning he confessed to have eaten his
companions. These remains were later found by searchers. Packer was
arrested but escaped. He was rearrested nine years later in
Wyoming. He was tried and sentenced to death. He was kept in a prison
in Gunnison for three years. His conviction was reversed on a
technicality. He was tried again and sentenced to 40 years.
He was freed in 1901 from the Canon City penitentiary through the
efforts of the publishers of the Denver Post who wanted to exhibit
Mr. Packer as part of a circus. As an outgrowth of the Packer affair,
the publishers were both shot by  attorney, William Anderson who was
tried three times before being aquitted. The judge told Mr. Anderson
"your motive was admirable, but your marksmanship abominable". The
same judge is reputed to have said to Mr. Packer "there were just
seven good Democrats in this country, and you ate five of them".
<p>
Supposedly, there are protest groups called "Packer Clubs" who protest
unpopular eating establishments.
<p>
Finally, I found that a biography was written on Mr. Packer by Fred
Mazzula. I have not been able to locate it, but the title is "Al
Packer: A Colorado Cannibal" printed privately in Denver 1968.
<p>
So is it Alfred or Alferd??
<p>
Another clarification from Matt Miller:
<p>
Apparently after joining the Iowa(?) army during the
civil war Alfred got a tatoo of his name on his arm.  The tatooist
mis-spelled his name as Alferd.  Alfred liked that name better and so
used it mostly from then on.  So his real name is Alfred but he called
himself Alferd as sortof a nickname.
<p>
Also, Packer was
discharged from the army because of epilepsy in case you're wondering
how his life went from military to scout.
<p>
Amanda says: I looked at his grave stone and it says "Alfred Packer".

Trey Parker (of South Park fame) did a movie about Packer:
