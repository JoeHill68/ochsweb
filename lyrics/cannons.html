<H1>The Cannons of Christianity</H1>
<H3>By Phil Ochs</H3>
<P>
<PRE>
          A                  D
Christian cannons have fired at my days
         D                   A
With the warning beneath the holy blaze
    Bm             G
And bow to our authority
         C                D
Say the cannons of Christianity

Oh the children will be sent to schools
Minds of clay are molded to their rules
Learn to fear all of eternity
Warn the cannons of Christianity

Holy hands will count the money raised
Like a king the Lord is richly praised
On a cross of diamond majesty
Say the cannons of Christianity

Missionaries will travel on crusades
The word is given, the heathen souls are saved
Conversions to our morality
Sigh the cannons of Christianity

Come the wars and turn the rules around
To bend your soul on the battle ground
And the Lord will march beside me
Drone the cannons of Christianity

Cathedral walls will glitter with their gold
And the sermons speak through silver robes
Building castles amidst the poverty
Say the cannons of Christianity

Worship now and wash your sins away
Drop the coins, fall to your knees and pray
Cleanse the world of all hypocrisy
Smile the cannons of Christianity

Christian cannons have fired at my days
With the warning beneath the holy blaze
And bow to our authority
Say the cannons of Christianity
</PRE>

<H3>Notes:</H3>
<P>
On to a tape I have, Phil, himself, says the chords are: D A D Bm G C D.
Thanks to <a href="mailto:cody@bloomington.in.us">cody</a> for
matching them up to the lyrics.
<p>
There has been some debate about whether the word is "cannons" or
"canons".  In the <cite>War is Over</cite> song book, the former is
used throughout and as the title.
