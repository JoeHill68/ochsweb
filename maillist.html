<H2>Phil Ochs Mailing List</H2>
<HR>
<p>
This mailing list was recently upgraded from "Majordomo" to "Mailman".
Information about the mailing list and how to subscribe can be found
<a href="https://mailhost.cecs.pdx.edu/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/no-more-songs">here</a>.
<P>
Archives of the mailing list are not available because of the disk
space required to keep them online and
I have also recieved complaints from people who do not like their
messages on the mailing list being indiscriminately archived and put
onto the web (rightfully so).
