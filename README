This is the Phil Ochs web site.  It started life as some text files on
an ftp server around 1990.  I converted it into a web site (my first)
sometime around 1992.  I've changed it rarely since 2000 and the last
change was in 2010.

I considered turning it into a wiki, but that's too much work, so I'll
put it here.  Feel free to fork and send me pull requests.

The web site can be found at http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/ochs/
(it's had that address since the beginning!)
