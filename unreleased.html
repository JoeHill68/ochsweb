<H1>Phil Ochs Unreleased and Rare Recordings</H1>

<P>
Suprisingly enough, on the 
<A HREF="maillist.html">mailing list</A>
some rare and unreleased recordings have turned up.
This is my attempt to catalog them.
Unlike other, frequently bootlegged artists (Dylan, The Dead, &c.),
there has been little tracking of when things were recorded
or when concerts happened.  I try to attach my best guesses,
but further input is welcome.

Felt Forum tribute concert 5/28/76-recorded from NPR, 2 hrs 15 minutes

<LI>
3 demos recorded for Broadside: You Can't Get So ??; Just One OF Those 
Days; How Long.   I don't think these are on the CD.

<LI>
Live 1964-WXPN-FM broadcast: I Ain't Marchin' Anymore; Draft Dodger 
Rag; Riot Song/Links On The Chain.   Venue unknown

Live at Yale 10/72: Here's To The State Of Richard Nixon.  This was 
sent out by the McGovern campaign committee as one track of a 10 1/2 
inch reel-to-reel stereo tape.

Swarthmore College 1964-WXPN-FM broadcast: Power & The Glory; William 
Worthy; One More Parade; There But For Fortune; Talking Vietnam; The 
Bells; Talking Plane Disasters And Massacres; Links On The Chain

<LI>
Studio recordings: William Moore; There But For Fortune; Talking 
Airplane Disaster; Paul Crump; What Are You Fighting For; The Harder They 
Fall; Kansas City Bomber; Power & Glory.   I think some of these got 
released on the A&M double LP released around 1976.  The first 5 may have 
been recorded for the Vanguard "New Folks" compilation LP(s).  
I'd have to dig out the tape to figure out the others.
