<P>
Some time before Phil Ochs died April 9, 1976, in Far Rockaway, NY, he gave
a benefit concert for Broadside.  He brought us about $500.  He also had the
concert taped and he turned the tape over to us with the suggestion we make
an LP Album out of it.  "Let's give 'em one more broadside," he said.  (It
took us some time to realize that there was a certain tone of finality in
this remark.)  We played the tape and commented "there's not enough material
on here to make a whole album and, besides, some of your best and strongest
songs are missing."  Phil laughed and pointed out "Look, you've got other
tapes of mine.  I don't think there's a single song I ever wrote that I
didn't tape for you.  Just splice on what you want.  It's all yours.  Have
Moe Asch put it out."
