<p>
Of course, Phil wrote a number of things while studying journalism at
Ohio State.  I do not have a listing of these, but I am told they are
easy to find at Ohio State.  I would welcome a listing of these
writings (I would be even happier to get copies).

Excluded are the many books
on rock or folk artists giving rather brief information (i.e., less than 
a page or so), Baggelaar & Milton have one of the best brief accounts on 
Ochs:

      It's a great book covering politics in pop from Joe Hill to Red
      Wedge. There's a lot of Phil coverage, two sections on him--a 10
      page and a 5 page, plus other Phil mentions on 13 other
      pages. Most of the book is heavy on Britain, where the author's
      from, but not too much so.

      about Dylan, Sprinsgteen, and Phil--a chapter essay given to each.
  <li>Chris Cutler, <cite>File Under Popular</cite>.
      Has a chapter about Phil.  ``it is a fine book, very much worth
      a read.'' -- Ross Goodman
  <li><cite>Something To Sing About:  The Personal Choices of American
      Folksingers</cite> (collected by Milt Okun, Macmillan Co. 1968).
      ``contains a full page on Phil. The accompanying photo is one I
      have never seen before--Phil in that old pinstriped,
      double-breasted jacket and farmer's cap, hugging the mannikin
      (Miranda I presume) with his left arm, while clutching a skull
      in his right.'' -- <a
