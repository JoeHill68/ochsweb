I got a report of the latter, which is a 2 CD set together with
<a href="i-aint.html">I Ain't Marching Anymore</a> and I
just saw it in a record store.

      On the LP this song was replaced with
      <A HREF="./lyrics/bullets-of-mexico.html">Bullets of Mexico</A>,
      which was included on the CD as an extra track.
      Although, some LP's apparently were not subject to replacement:
      someone from Australia reports buying a copy in 1965 like this,
      as does someone in the states (the latter was a mono LP).
